*Retroactive Continuity as Research-Creation Practice*

## Abstract

Drawing from comic book narrative techniques, this essay proposes "retcon" (retroactive continuity) as both theoretical framework and operational methodology for addressing computational futurality in research-creation contexts.

---

## I. Origins of Retcon

In serialized comic narratives, retcon refers to the practice of retroactively altering established facts to accommodate new storylines. Rather than viewing this as mere revision, we can understand retcon as a generative practice that creates new continuities between past and present.

---

## II. Black Mountain College as Retcon Site

The experimental pedagogy of Black Mountain College (1933-1957) — with its cybernetic teaching, interdisciplinary practice, and communal organization — offers a historical site ripe for retconning. The question is not "what really happened at BMC?" but rather "what continuities can be constructed between BMC and contemporary AI-assisted creation?"
