## Preamble: The Tipping Point

The classical archive rested on a promise: to preserve traces of the past in order to transmit them to the future. This promise was accompanied by an implicit ontology—that of a linear time in which the document, once recorded, remained stable, consultable, verifiable. The archival gesture consisted of selecting, classifying, preserving. The archivist was guardian of a repository, mediator between the dead and the living, guarantor of referential continuity. This conception, which structured documentary practices from the nineteenth century through the end of the twentieth, now finds itself radically destabilized.

The massive integration of language models and generative artificial intelligence into the very infrastructure of knowledge has precipitated a rupture whose scope we are only beginning to measure. We are no longer in an era of search and retrieval, but in an era of generation and synthesis. The archive no longer merely stores the past; it hallucinates the future probabilistically. The user no longer queries the database to retrieve a specific preexisting document. They prompt a model to generate a response based on a statistical compression of the archive. This shift is properly ontological: truth is no longer defined by correspondence to a stored record, but by what we might call ontological efficacy—the capacity of a synthetic artifact to acquire causal traction in the world and to durably integrate itself into the fabric of reality.

This essay proposes to analyze this transformation through the concept of the *recursive query*—understood both as a technical database function and as a conceptual metaphor. In computer science, a recursive query is a query that references itself to solve complex hierarchical problems or traverse graph structures. Conceptually, the age of AI represents a large-scale recursive query: the archive now interrogates itself, training on its own productions, and generating a synthetic layer of reality that feeds back into the preconscious material infrastructure.

This recursivity carries a major risk: model collapse, where AI systems trained on data generated by other AI systems sink into a self-referential loop, progressively losing all grounding in the reality of human experience. To escape this impasse, we must look beyond the linear and accelerationist time of Western technology. We must mobilize cosmotechnics—the articulation of cosmic and moral orders through technique—and the alternative temporalities it reveals: cyclical, ancestral, relational times capable of breaking the closure of algorithmic flow.

## I. Archaeology of the Archive: From Consignment to Computation

### 1.1 The Archive as Condition of Possibility

The archive has never been a mere receptacle. Michel Foucault, in his *Archaeology of Knowledge*, demonstrated this with decisive clarity: the archive does not designate the totality of texts that a civilization has preserved, nor the institutions that enable their preservation. The archive names the system of rules that determines what can be said, what counts as an acceptable statement, what enters the historical register and what disappears from it. The archive is the condition of possibility of discourse—and its limits. It does not passively preserve the past; it actively produces what counts as historical reality through processes of selection, classification, and interpretation.

Jacques Derrida extended this analysis by examining what he calls *archive fever*—that simultaneous desire to preserve and that recognition that preservation always implies destruction, selection, the imposition of order upon materials that resist systematization. For Derrida, the archive is haunted by what it excludes, by the traces that were never recorded or that were erased in the very act of archiving. What becomes, then, of minority archives—those of marginalized communities, vernacular practices, undocumented knowledge—when latent space reproduces and amplifies the exclusions already inscribed in training corpora? This spectral dimension acquires particular significance when we consider digital archives, where the appearance of exhaustive preservation masks new forms of selection and transformation.

Derrida wrote that "the technical structure of the archiving archive also determines the structure of the archivable content right from its very coming into existence and in its relationship to the future." This formulation is prophetic: it anticipates precisely the current condition where technical systems no longer merely store but generate, where the archive no longer merely preserves but predicts, where the document no longer testifies to a past but configures a future.

### 1.2 Tertiary Retention and Its Mutations

Bernard Stiegler developed, building on Husserl, a decisive conceptualization for understanding this transformation. He distinguishes three forms of memory that constitute consciousness. Primary retention designates the immediate perception of the now, the present flow—hearing a note of music at the moment it resonates. Secondary retention is the memory of this perception, filtered through imagination—recalling the melody afterward. Tertiary retention names the externalization of memory in technical objects—a vinyl recording of the melody, a book, an archive, a database.

For Stiegler, human consciousness is epiphylogenetic: we evolve not only biologically, but through our tools and archives, inheriting a past we have not biologically lived but technically adopt. Tertiary retentions—from writing to printing, from photography to cinema, from computing to networks—constitute the technical milieu in which individual and collective consciousness forms and transforms.

Yet Yuk Hui observes that the digital era has shifted the center of gravity of tertiary retention toward what he calls tertiary protention. Protention, in Husserl, designates the anticipation of the immediate future. In the era of recommendation algorithms and predictive AI, machines no longer merely store data; they anticipate our needs, our desires, our future queries. The archive is no longer a place we go to remember. It is a machine that tells us what we are going to do. It is a technology of anticipation, ranging from text prediction to behavior prediction.

This shift from retention to protention constitutes what Hui calls a new political regime—a politics of anticipation rather than memory. When tertiary protention becomes automated and dominant, it short-circuits the human capacity to imagine the future. We become passive consumers of a future pre-calculated by the archive. Stiegler speaks of a proletarianization of the mind, where savoir-vivre and savoir-faire are transferred to the machine. This short-circuit is the direct effect of the recursive query applied to human behaviors: the system takes our past data, applies a recursive prediction function, and generates our probable future, locking us in a feedback loop that eliminates contingency.

### 1.2 bis — The Infrastructure of Recursivity

The recursivity we are analyzing is not an abstract property of information. It is implemented in a specific material infrastructure—what Benjamin Bratton calls The Stack.

The Stack designates the planetary architecture of contemporary computation, organized in superimposed layers: the Earth (mines, submarine cables, data centers), the Cloud (protocols, APIs, models), the City (urban networks, sensors, management systems), the Address (geolocation, identification), the Interface (screens, input devices), the User (profiles, behaviors, data). Each layer has its own geopolitics. The submarine cables that carry more than 95% of global internet traffic pass through strategic control points; data centers are established where electricity is cheap and regulation loose—Iceland, Ireland, Singapore; models are trained by companies concentrated in a few jurisdictions—primarily the United States and, increasingly, China.

This infrastructure has a cost. Training GPT-4 reportedly cost approximately 100 million dollars and emitted the carbon equivalent of several hundred transatlantic flights. Google's data centers consumed 21.2 billion liters of water in 2022 for cooling. Chile's lithium mines are draining the aquifers of the Atacama Desert. *Computational recursivity*—this capacity of systems to self-reference and iterate on their own productions—has a price, and this price is paid by the planet and its most vulnerable inhabitants.

Jennifer Gabrys, in *Program Earth*, observes that the Earth itself is becoming computational. Environmental sensors, observation satellites, climate models form a monitoring infrastructure that transforms the relationship between technique and cosmos. But this "programmed Earth" is not a return to a harmonious cosmotechnics; it is a new form of extraction where the planetary itself becomes informational resource. Climate data feeds predictive models that serve financial risk management as much as environmental protection.

Tiziana Terranova named "free labor" the unpaid work that users provide to platforms in exchange for access to services. This concept, developed as early as 2000, anticipates the current condition: our queries, our corrections, our preferences feed the recursive loops that train the models. The transindividuation that Stiegler describes—this co-constitution of individuals and collectives through engagement with technical systems—is also an extraction. We co-constitute ourselves with machines, but the value of this co-constitution is captured by the owners of the infrastructure.

Recursivity is therefore not merely a logical structure or an ontological mode of being; it is an economic operation. Each feedback loop—each iteration where the system learns from its own outputs—is also a cycle of accumulation where collectively produced value is privately appropriated. The Model Collapse we will analyze further on is not only a technical risk; it is the symptom of a system that, lacking new human inputs to extract, begins to devour itself.

### 1.3 The Archive as Social Construction

Work on archives of marginalized practices—whether weaving at Black Mountain College, feminist histories, or indigenous knowledge—reveals with particular acuity the constructed character of every archival formation. What is preserved depends on who has the power to define what counts. Weaving survives poorly in archives precisely because it was associated with the feminine and the domestic. When 75% of the students at Black Mountain who took weaving classes were women, and most of them "married and raised children" after their studies, their activities were generally considered hobbies by their families. Whether their creative work was valued by their husbands or children plays a determining role in the preservation of these materials. The interview with Michael Beggs, co-author with Julie Thomson of the book *Weaving at Black Mountain* (2023), conducted during the ARC reminds us of this.

This gendered devaluation has direct consequences for what the archive preserves and what it erases. The archive preserves only transmissions that pass through recognized forms—publication, institutional teaching. How many lineages of influence remain invisible for lack of institutional traces? The Albers-Blumenau lineage is documentable because Blumenau herself published and taught. But this visibility is the exception rather than the rule.

There is a lesson here for thinking the archive in the age of AI. Language models are trained on corpora that reproduce and amplify these historical biases. What was marginalized in traditional archives remains so in computational archives—with the difference that statistical compression naturalizes these biases, rendering them invisible under the appearance of algorithmic neutrality.

## II. The Logic of Recursivity: From SQL to Cybernetics

### 2.1 The Technical Definition

To grasp the change in the archive's status, we must first understand the technical and philosophical mechanism of recursivity. It is the operational logic of the digital age, governing everything from database structures to the feedback loops of machine learning.

The anchor member is the fixed starting point: "begin with this document." Consider the archives of Anni Albers at Black Mountain College—photographs of her weavings, digitized textile samples, course notes, correspondence. This is the stable given, the entry into the archive, the ground truth.

The recursive member is the part that repeats: "now, find everything linked to the previous result." Albers's students, the works they produced, the artists they influenced, and so on. The query re-executes on its own result—each level reveals the next.

The process stops when there is nothing more to find—no more links, no more connected documents. This termination condition is essential: without it, the loop would run indefinitely.

This structure is paradigmatic of the current condition of generative AI. The anchor member corresponds to the corpus of human data—Albers's archives as they were digitized and ingested into training datasets, the Internet up to approximately 2023. The recursive member corresponds to the generative model: when asked to produce "a weaving in the style of Anni Albers," it generates an image that exists in no archive—but which could, tomorrow, be scraped and reintegrated into the next dataset. The UNION ALL operation—which combines anchor and recursion—produces the mixed reality of today's web where real Albers and fake Albers coexist indiscernibly.

But the termination condition is lacking. Nothing any longer distinguishes the archival document from its synthetic proliferation. The loop continues endlessly, and the archive dissolves into its own simulacra.

Unlike an SQL query that possesses a strict termination condition to avoid infinite loops, the generative AI loop risks becoming an infinite recursion of synthetic content. The anchor—historical human reality—is increasingly diluted by recursive production—synthetic reality—leading to a saturation of informational space by simulacra. The recursive query, without ontological brake, becomes a process of informational entropy.

### 2.2 The Philosophy of Recursivity

Yuk Hui elevates recursivity from a simple computational function to a fundamental category of existence. In *Recursivity and Contingency*, he shows that recursivity is not simply mechanical repetition; it is the mode by which a system—whether organic or machinic—incorporates contingency in order to maintain, individuate, and evolve itself.

Hui revisits the history of philosophy to show how Western thought has attempted to understand the organization of the living and the machine. Cartesian mechanism is linear, cause-effect. The archive there is a card catalog, a static space where order is imposed from outside. The Kantian organism and cybernetics are circular, driven by feedback. The system has an internal end. In Norbert Wiener's cybernetics, the machine begins to have a purpose thanks to negative feedback that corrects error.

Hui argues that the organic and the machinic become indiscernible because both operate via recursive feedback loops. However, there is a crucial difference. Organic recursivity is open to contingency. The organism encounters the unexpected and integrates it to evolve. Closed mechanical recursivity, if it remains purely computational—stripped of any moral or cosmic grounding—leads to a gigantic cybernetic system that closes in on itself.

In the context of the archive, this means we are passing from a mechanical archive to a cybernetic archive. User interaction modifies the archive—personalization algorithms learn from the query. But if this system is not open to the outside, to the inhuman or the accidental, it becomes a totalizing prison, a perfect control system that eliminates all genuine novelty in favor of statistical prediction.

### 2.3 Protentional Closure

Antoinette Rouvroy has conceptualized this regime under the name algorithmic governmentality—a mode of power that operates not through discipline or normalization but through statistical modeling of behavioral possibilities. Contemporary computational systems short-circuit subjectivity, addressing individuals only as aggregates of correlatable data points. This regime produces a statistical reality that preempts events before they occur, closing the space of political and creative indetermination.

Shoshana Zuboff completes this diagnosis by revealing the economic infrastructure that supports these operations. Surveillance capitalism, as she calls it, extracts a behavioral surplus from human activity, converting lived experience into predictive commodities. The archive, in this framework, is no longer a site of collective memory but a resource for markets in behavioral futures. The division of learning that Zuboff identifies—corporations accumulate knowledge about populations while those populations remain ignorant of what is known about them—directly threatens the conditions of collective self-narration that archives have historically made possible.

The social media feed, based on recursive queries, traps users in a loop of perpetual now, reinforcing existing biases and preventing the emergence of the new. It is a tyranny of the immediate present. The proliferation of AI-generated content creates a stagnant, self-reproducing echo chamber—the bad infinity of a recursive query without exit condition. The Internet risks becoming a cemetery of simulacra, where human history stops around 2023, the approximate date of the end of clean corpora.

## III. The Artifact as Archive: Toward an Expanded Ontology of the Document

### 3.1 Beyond Text

Research on archives of material practices—weaving, ceramics, craft—compels us to expand the conception of the document. In the Black Mountain College archives, one finds a folder "Anni Albers — Weaving Workshop" containing a subfolder "Student Works, 1944." Inside: a dozen textile samples. No names, no precise dates, no written instructions.

Faced with this silence, the textiles themselves become the true archives of pedagogy—more reliable than any course description. The produced object does not represent teaching; it embodies it. It does not describe the gesture; it incorporates it.

This inversion of documentary status opens ontological questions. A textile woven by a student in 1944 was not intended to become an archive—it becomes one eighty years later when a researcher uses it to reconstruct a pedagogy. When one reads a textile to understand how it was taught, what exactly is one doing? Is it reading, deduction, reconstruction? Does the object resist interpretation differently than a text?

Unlike the written document that fixes a moment—the dated letter, the minutes—the artifact carries within it a duration: the time of making, its uses, its degradations. And unlike the letter, often written with awareness of its possible preservation, the weaving exercise was not. It becomes archive retroactively. The object not intended for preservation perhaps carries a truth that the consciously archived document cannot attain: that of the unsupervised gesture, of practice not performed for posterity.

### 3.3 The Generative Archive and Latent Space

In machine learning, latent space is the multidimensional mathematical space where the model stores its understanding of data. Similar concepts are grouped together—all images of chairs are mathematically close to tables. When we prompt an AI, we traverse this latent space. We do not retrieve a document; we interpolate a path between points in this high-dimensional archive.

When an AI generates an image or text, it dreams—compressing and reconstructing data from latent space. It is a form of unconscious creation, the return of the repressed of data, but stripped of its original context. The generative archive is no longer a repository of verified facts but a space of latent potentialities.

This transformation poses the question of what it means to archive in the generative age. If the traditional archive preserved discrete, identifiable, datable documents, the latent archive dissolves these properties into a statistical continuum. The document no longer exists as a separate entity but as a contribution to a probability distribution. The original and the copy, the true and the false, the authentic and the synthetic lose their distinction in this space where everything is interpolation.

## IV. Cosmotechnics and Technodiversity

### 4.1 Western Monotechnics

If the recursive query of AI creates a closed loop, how do we escape it? The philosopher Yuk Hui proposes a conceptual tool: cosmotechnics.

The idea is simple but powerful. Since Heidegger, we often think of Technology as a unique and universal force—what he called *Gestell*, *Enframing*—that imposes itself everywhere in the same way. Hui contests this vision. He shows that different cultures have historically produced different techniques, because they had different visions of the cosmos. Cosmotechnics is precisely this: the way a culture articulates its technical gestures to its understanding of the order of the world.

Two examples. Greek cosmotechnics, founded on techne and episteme, seeks to discover the eternal laws of nature. To know is to measure; beauty is found in proportion. Traditional Chinese cosmotechnics, founded on Dao and Qi, does not aim to master nature but to harmonize with it. Technique must resonate with the cosmos, not subjugate it.

The modern problem: a single cosmotechnics—the Western one, which aims at mastery of nature through mathematical calculation—has universalized itself under the name of "Technology" with a capital T. This monotechnics imposes on the entire world a forced synchronization: a single time, that of acceleration; a single logic, that of optimization. Local temporalities, alternative cosmologies, other ways of doing technique are crushed or folklorized.

### 4.2 The Geometry of Time versus Resonance

Cosmotechnics is not only a critical tool—it opens a constructive possibility. If different cultures have produced different techniques, then the current monotechnics is not a fatality. Yuk Hui names technodiversity this project: not folklorizing local techniques by museumifying them, but building technical systems that genuinely embody other relations to time, memory, and relation.

What would this mean for the archive? An archive built on the Western model presupposes a linear time (the timestamp), discrete objects (the file), a sharp separation between dead past and living present (the creation date). The document is closed; consultation does not modify it; the archive preserves what no longer is. These presuppositions seem so obvious that we forget them—until other cosmotechnics reveal them by contrast.

The concept of *Tjukurrpa*—often translated as "the Dream" or "Dreamtime"—is generally misunderstood as a creation myth situated in a distant past. The anthropologist W.E.H. Stanner coined the term *Everywhen* to correct this misunderstanding: Tjukurrpa is not a "long ago," it is a parallel reality structure where ancestors are continuously creating the world. The *Songlines*—sung paths that traverse the continent—function as a distributed database: each point in the landscape is an entry, accessible through the appropriate song and ritual. But unlike a digital database, this archive requires bodily maintenance: if the ritual is not performed, if the song is not sung, the land itself degrades. The archive is not a passive repository—it is an active relation that engages the bodies of the living.

Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui, a Bolivian sociologist, proposes the Aymara concept of *ch'ixi* to think what Western dialectics fails to grasp. Ch'ixi designates what is simultaneously one thing and its opposite—the gray that contains white and black without fusing them, the mottled stone where colors coexist without blending. Unlike Hegelian synthesis that resolves contradictions by superseding them, ch'ixi maintains tension. Applied to the archive, this concept allows us to think documentary formations where past and present, original and copy, human trace and algorithmic generation coexist without resolution. The ch'ixi archive would not be a space of reconciliation but of productive tension—one would not decide between true and false, one would inhabit their copresence.

These concepts are not recipes to implement. We are not going to code an "Everywhen database" or a "ch'ixi algorithm"—that would be precisely falling back into the extractive logic that reduces other cosmologies to resources for Western innovation. Their function is different: they operate as diagnostics by contrast. By revealing what the computational archive presupposes (linear time, discrete objects, closed past, consultation without consequence), they open space to ask questions we were not asking. Could an archive demand something of the one who consults it? Could a document transform itself through the use made of it? Could the relation to the past be something other than extraction of information?

These questions are not rhetorical. They outline the specifications for an archive that would escape the recursive loop—not by accelerating it, but by phase-shifting it.

## VI. Retcon as Method

### 6.1 Retroactive Continuity

The term *retcon*—contraction of *retroactive continuity*—comes from comic book culture, where later episodes modify the meaning of earlier events without erasing them. Applied to archival practice, *retcon* does not falsify history but activates latent possibilities in documentary traces, producing what we might call counterfactual coherence.

This approach aligns with what Kodwo Eshun describes as the chronopolitical dimension of Afrofuturist practice. In his essay "Further Considerations on Afrofuturism" (2003), Eshun shows that power is exercised not only over space—territories, resources, bodies—but also over time. To control a people's past is to control their future: whoever writes history delimits what is thinkable as future. The Atlantic slave trade did not only deport bodies; it broke temporal lineages, cut access to genealogical archives, imposed a "past" made solely of slavery and dispossession.

Afrofuturism, as Eshun theorizes it, is a chronopolitical counter-offensive. It is not simply about imagining Black futures in space—although that is part of it—but about retroactively producing pasts that make those futures possible. Sun Ra claiming to come from Saturn, Drexciya inventing an underwater civilization founded by descendants of slaves thrown overboard during the crossing: these gestures are not escapist fantasies. They are interventions on the archive itself, retcons avant la lettre that insert into the past elements capable of reconfiguring the present.

Eshun writes: "Struggles over the image of the future are struggles over the image of the past." The formula is reversible: struggles over the archive are always already struggles over what can come to be. An archive that contains only documents of oppression can only generate a future of emancipation *against* that oppression—never a future that would be rooted in something else. To produce other documents, or to read existing documents otherwise, is to open other trajectories.

*Retcon* fully assumes this chronopolitical dimension. It recognizes that all historical knowledge is produced—not simply found—through processes of selection, synthesis, and projection of present concerns onto archival materials. The archive is never neutral; it is always already oriented toward a particular future. The question is therefore not to choose between a "true" history and an "invented" one, but to decide which pasts we want to activate—and for which futures.

When *retcon* is conducted with AI systems, it becomes doubly recursive: the machine draws from interpretations accumulated in its training data, generating new texts that themselves become available for future archival processing. The experiment influences what it experiments on. This is not a bug but a feature—the recursive loop becomes intervention mechanism, means of shaping the systems that shape us.

### 6.2 The Speculative Archive

Mark Fisher, in his reflections on hauntology, theorized lost futures—unrealized possibilities that haunt the present, trajectories that were opened at a given moment but were not pursued. The archives of experimental projects like Black Mountain College preserve precisely such lost futures: pedagogical and artistic innovations that were not absorbed into dominant practice and remain available for contemporary reactivation.

The speculative archive does not merely document what was but opens onto what might have been and what might yet become. It treats documents not as testimonies of a closed past but as virtualities awaiting actualization. This conception meets what François Hartog calls presentism—the contemporary regime of historicity where the present invades both past and future—but reverses it: instead of closing the temporal horizon, the speculative archive reopens it by activating latent potentialities of the past.

### 6.3 Distributed Subjectivity

The integration of AI into archival and artistic practice poses the question of creative agency. The humanist tradition attributed creativity to an individual subject endowed with intentionality, emotional resonance, and cultural grounding. These three dimensions constitute what we might call transformational creativity—the capacity not only to generate new elements within an existing framework but to dismantle, reconstruct, and redefine the framework itself.

Current AI systems excel at combinatorial creativity—recombining existing elements—and exploratory creativity—exploring the possibilities of a given conceptual space. But they struggle with transformational creativity, which requires the capacity to interrogate one's own conditions of operation. AI does not interrogate its own conditions of operation; it extrapolates from preexisting data, functioning within a conceptual space without ever questioning its parameters.

However, collaborative practice with AI is not reducible to the opposition creative human versus imitative machine. It brings forth a form of distributed subjectivity where agency is distributed among human and non-human actors in ways that do not totalize into subjective wholes. The work that emerges is truly collaborative, not in the sense that two or more subjects cooperate, but in the sense that agency is distributed across human and non-human actors, historical archives and real-time processing, individual intentions and statistical tendencies.

## VII. Transindividuation Under Algorithmic Conditions

### 7.1 The Aggregation Argument

Two classical arguments hold that computation is antithetical to authentic collective creativity.

The aggregation argument. The first asserts that computation can accomplish only aggregation of preexisting elements, not the emergent synthesis that characterizes true collective creation. This argument has a long and formidable pedigree. As early as the 1940s, Adorno and Horkheimer saw in the culture industry a machine for combining standardized elements: "Each product presents itself as individual; individuality itself contributes to reinforcing ideology, insofar as it awakens the illusion that what is completely reified and mediated is a refuge of immediacy and life" (*Dialectic of Enlightenment*, 1944). Computation, in this perspective, would only industrialize this process of recombination more efficiently.

More recently, proponents of relational aesthetics have reformulated this critique. Nicolas Bourriaud defines relational art as "a set of artistic practices which take as their theoretical and practical point of departure the whole of human relations and their social context, rather than an autonomous and private space" (*Relational Aesthetics*, 1998). What counts is not the object produced but the quality of the encounters it generates. Yet computation, by definition, mediates: it interposes processing between participants, substituting data synchronization for bodily co-presence.

The argument rests on an implicit premise: collective creativity is irreducibly relational, emerging from intersubjective encounters that no computation can simulate. Durkheim named collective effervescence this moment when the group transcends the sum of its members: "Vital energies are over-excited, passions more vivid, sensations stronger; there are even some that are produced only at this moment" (*The Elementary Forms of Religious Life*, 1912). This effervescence presupposes physical co-presence, affective contagion, synchronization of bodies in space and time—everything that sequential processing of discrete data seems incapable of producing.

The second argument asserts that computation operates through pattern recognition and therefore cannot generate authentic innovation. When an AI system processes an archive, generates recommendations, or produces synthetic documents, it engages in detection and reproduction of statistical regularities. The process is analogous to applying templates: the model has learned that certain sequences follow certain others, and it generates accordingly. Creativity, however, is often defined precisely as disruption of regularities—a leap beyond or against recognized patterns. Philosophically, this concern goes back to Bergson. In *Creative Evolution* (1907), he distinguishes intelligence—which "clearly represents only the discontinuous" and proceeds by analysis, decomposition, recombination—from intuition, alone capable of grasping duration and élan vital. "Of creation thus considered, there can be no representation, because the creation of new forms is something unforeseeable and incalculable." Patterns can only carry you as far as past experience extends; beyond, one must invoke something that defies codification.

Hubert Dreyfus updated this critique in the context of artificial intelligence. In *What Computers Can't Do* (1972), then *What Computers Still Can't Do* (1992), he argues that human expertise rests on an embodied and contextual understanding that no formalization can capture. The novice follows rules; the expert has internalized a capacity for judgment that escapes explication. Computation, prisoner of explicit rules and patterns, would be structurally incapable of attaining this expertise—and a fortiori the creativity that surpasses it.

These two arguments converge toward the same conclusion: computation can *simulate* collective creativity, but never *accomplish* it. It can aggregate contributions, detect regularities, optimize combinations—but the moment of genuine emergence would escape it in principle.

### 7.2 Transindividuation as Overcoming

Contemporary theorists have increasingly contested the view that computation and collective creativity are antithetical. They argue instead that the two are potentially complementary and that any rigid dichotomy between algorithmic processing and emergent collective practice neglects the complexities of how communities actually form and transform through technical mediation.

Bernard Stiegler has been particularly influential in dissecting the assumption that technical mediation necessarily diminishes collective life. Drawing on phenomenology, philosophy of technology, and critical theory, Stiegler argues that technical systems, though often presented as external impositions on authentic community, should not be construed so narrowly. Human collectives have always constituted themselves through technical mediation—from language and writing to printing and telecommunications.

Stiegler's notion of *transindividuation* emphasizes that individuals and collectives actively co-constitute each other through shared engagement with technical systems, a process that involves adaptive appropriation rather than passive subjection. To understand the notion of *transindividuation* in Stiegler, we must first return to Simondon. In *Psychic and Collective Individuation* (1989), Simondon breaks with the idea that the individual would be a stable and preformed entity. The individual is not a starting point but a process—it individuates itself permanently, through its relations with its technical and social milieu. More radically still: the individual and its milieu co-constitute each other. One cannot think one without the other, because it is their relation that brings both into being.

Technical objects play a crucial role in this process. Simondon refuses to reduce them to mere tools, neutral and passive, that the human would use from outside. The technical object has its own mode of existence, its own logic of development—what he calls concretization. And the human who engages with this object transforms themselves through this contact: the blacksmith who learns their trade does not remain the same; their gestures, their perceptions, their relation to the world reconfigure themselves through their relation with the hammer, the anvil, the fire.

Stiegler radicalizes this intuition by introducing the concept of transindividuation. Where Simondon speaks of psychic individuation (the individual) and collective individuation (the group), Stiegler insists on their coupling through technical objects—which he calls tertiary retentions: those material supports of memory (writing, archives, databases) that enable the transmission and transformation of knowledge. Transindividuation designates this process by which individuals and collectives actively co-constitute each other through their shared engagement with these technical systems.

Stiegler rigorously distinguishes two regimes. In the first, the individual is a passive consumer: they receive preformatted contents, absorb them without transforming them, and adapt to them. This is the regime of proletarianization—the loss of knowledge to systems that think in our place. In the second, the individual is an active adopter: they appropriate the technical system, divert it, interpret it, reconfigure it through their use. This is the regime of genuine *transindividuation*—that in which engagement with technique produces the new, at both individual and collective levels.

This distinction changes everything in the question of computation and creativity. If we remain in the first regime, the classical critique holds: computation formats, standardizes, passively aggregates. But if we pass to the second regime, computation can become what Stiegler calls an associated milieu—a technical environment that encourages experimentation, reinterpretation, collective novelty. The computational tool then becomes a scaffold: it does not produce creativity in place of humans, but it supports and amplifies processes of transindividuation that surpass it.

A piece of software used by a community of practice is never exactly what the engineers designed: actual uses overflow it, divert it, make it do what it was not supposed to do. It is in this gap between design and appropriation that the possibility of a computationally mediated but not computationally determined collective creativity lodges itself.

### 7.3 Creative Appropriation of Constraints

Sociological research reinforces these philosophical arguments. Actor-Network Theory, developed by Bruno Latour, Michel Callon, and John Law, points toward the ways technical objects participate as actants in the constitution of collective life. Even if computational mediation appears aggregative, this aggregation quickly mutates into something more dynamic as communities appropriate technical systems for their own ends.

Yochai Benkler's analysis of commons-based peer production underscores the collaborative dimension of digitally mediated practice: distributed participants co-construct solutions through networked platforms, eventually generating and sustaining collective innovations that exceed individual contribution. Far from being the enemy of collective creativity, computational mediation becomes a crucible for distributed coordination, building foundations from which communities can diverge and eventually forge emergent configurations.

Stiegler's emphasis on the active role of collective appropriation also challenges the assumption that pattern detection intrinsically excludes creativity. As thinkers from Simondon to Donna Haraway have observed, original collective formations often arise not despite technical constraints but through them. Stiegler likewise observes that inherited technical systems, archival structures, and computational tools serve as a reservoir of raw materials that can be recombined into new constellations of meaning.

Engaging with the documentary patterns of an archive does not confine a collective to fixed interpretations. The opposite occurs: the archive equips the collective with a repertoire of historical traces—raw material for appropriation, subversion, transformation. Inherited patterns become resources for producing what did not yet exist. This is precisely what *retcon* must accomplish: not a repetition of the past, but its *activation* toward unprecedented futures.

## VIII. Toward a Recursive Aesthetics

### 8.1 Principles

The preceding investigations point toward what we might call a recursive aesthetics—an approach to creation adequate to the conditions of computational recursion. This is not a style or movement but a set of concerns, methods, orientations that inform how work can be made and understood.

Recursive aesthetics takes feedback loops as formal principle and as material. Works structured by recursion—outputs fed back as inputs, processes folding back on themselves—make visible the recursive condition of contemporary life. They do not represent recursion from outside but instantiate it, inviting viewers into the loops.

Recursive aesthetics embraces the dissolution of stable authority. The artist is not sovereign creator but participant in distributed processes involving human and computational agents, historical archives and real-time processing, individual intention and statistical tendency. It engages history not as fixed past but as material for revision, recognizing that all historical knowledge is produced through processes of selection and interpretation.

### 8.2 Documentation and Critique

Recursive aesthetics requires new forms of documentation, critique, theorization. Traditional art historical methods presuppose individual authors producing discrete works at specific moments. These presuppositions falter under recursive conditions. New approaches are needed that can track distributed agencies, trace archival flows, evaluate interventions across multiple temporal scales.

Research-creation practice contributes to developing these approaches, generating not only works but also the conceptual apparatus for understanding them. The work becomes laboratory for experimentation, modeling possibilities that might be taken up, modified, extended.

The recursive condition means this experimentation already feeds back on the systems it investigates. If an artist-researcher develops new approaches to AI-assisted education and documents them in texts that enter circulation, these texts can influence how others think about these questions, potentially becoming material that shapes future AI development.

## IX. Stewardship of the Loop

### 9.1 From User to Guardian

The question is not to escape the recursive loop—it is structural, inevitable once a system trains on its own outputs. The question is how to inhabit it.

This begins with lucidity. Lucidity about political stakes: who owns the models, who decides on datasets, who benefits from outputs, who is invisibilized in statistical distributions. Lucidity about ecological stakes: each query consumes water, electricity, rare minerals; the "cloud" has a geology and this geology is extractive. Lucidity about epistemic stakes: Western monotechnics universalizes itself under cover of neutrality, crushing other cosmotechnics at the very moment it claims to archive them.

It is this lucidity—and not abstract voluntarism—that leads to a situated practice. Not "Universal Machines" but local machines, grounded in the moral and cosmic orders of the communities they serve. Not "users" of the archive but guardians of the loop—stewards who maintain the link between system and its outside, who correct drift before collapse.

### 9.2 Protocol and Sovereignty

The indigenous AI movement provides protocolary and architectural responses to the closure of the recursive loop. The work of Tahu Kukutai, John Taylor, and their collaborators on indigenous data sovereignty (*Indigenous Data Sovereignty*, 2016) establishes principles that contrast radically with dominant extractivism.

Indigenous knowledge emphasizes relational responsibility. One cannot simply scrape indigenous data for a language model—this constitutes colonial extraction. One must follow protocols of consent and kinship. Data are not resources to exploit; they are relations to maintain. This perspective reverses the logic of the Stack: instead of layers of abstraction that progressively distance the user from materiality, indigenous protocols insist on grounding, localization, responsibility toward territory.

The frameworks developed in Aotearoa/New Zealand—notably by Te Mana Raraunga, the Māori data sovereignty network—reframe data governance through Whakapapa (genealogical interconnection: all data has a genealogy, a provenance, relations) and Kaitiakitanga (responsible guardianship: data is a taonga, a treasure of which one is guardian, not owner). The model is not a linear production line but a virtuous recursivity that includes community governance at each loop, that maintains the relation between technical system and its social and ecological milieu.

Arturo Escobar, from a Latin American perspective, thinks alternatives to Western design in *Designs for the Pluriverse* (2018). His concept of "pluriverse"—against the single universe of Western modernity—joins Hui's technodiversity but grounds it in concrete struggles for territorial autonomy. Zapatista communities in Chiapas, movements for buen vivir in Ecuador and Bolivia develop technical practices that aim not at optimization and growth but at sufficiency and relation.

Algorithmic systems—if they are useful!—must not serve a disembodied intelligence but an extension of the social and ecological body of the territory. They must be attached to the localized laws inherent to Country—what Australian Aboriginal traditions call Country. This demand for grounding is not antimodern romanticism; it is a condition of sustainability. An uprooted recursivity—that refers only to itself, without attachment to the material and social world—is destined for collapse. Indigenous protocols offer models for a situated, responsible, relational recursivity.

### 9.3 Certification and Provenance

Work on digital archives aligns with the idea that the future archive must move from curation to certification. We must be able to say: this story comes from a human, and this human gave their consent. Faced with the proliferation of synthetic content, provenance becomes the central archival question.

This implies developing systems that maintain data traceability across algorithmic transformations, that preserve metadata of consent and context, that make it possible to distinguish ground truth from synthetic generation. Not to exclude the synthetic—which is now part of our reality—but to maintain the possibility of distinction.

## Coda: The Archive in Dormancy

The archive is not a moribund and dusty space. It is precisely a space in *dormancy*: it is a matrix—a site of recursive becoming.

This text has described a movement: the dissolution of documentary singularities into statistical compression, the loss of provenance in latent space, the erasure of distinctions between original and synthetic in the generative flow. I would like to propose the term *liquid archive* to describe this regime where everything merges into weighted average, where minority perspectives disappear into the dominant distribution, where the recursive query runs without termination condition. The *liquid archive* no longer preserves; it generates. It no longer testifies; it hallucinates. It is the archive of *model collapse*—the bad infinity of a system that, lacking new human interactions to extract, begins to devour itself.

But this text has also traversed counter-movements: indigenous protocols that insist on genealogy and consent, alternative cosmotechnics that refuse forced synchronization, *retcon* that activates lost futures rather than repeating the past, transindividuation that transforms use into creative appropriation. Let us call *prismatic archive* this regime where perspectives are diffracted without being dissolved, where singularity is maintained through its transformations, where collective governance of the statistical commons prevents closure of the loop. The *prismatic archive* is not the opposite of liquefaction—it inhabits it otherwise. It introduces into it what resists the average: claimed opacity, localized responsibility.

These two figures are not successive states but simultaneous tensions. Every contemporary archive oscillates between them. The Stack liquefies; protocols prismatize. Latent space dissolves; *retcon* diffracts. Tertiary protention closes the horizon; cosmotechnics reopens it. The challenge is not to choose—liquefaction is structural, irreversible—but to inject prism into the liquid. This implies reintroducing, at each iteration of the recursive loop, the elements that statistical compression tends to eliminate: the materiality of infrastructures (energy costs, mining extraction, water consumption), minority perspectives (marginalized knowledge, vernacular archives, alternative cosmotechnics), and the irreducible contingency of the real (what still escapes vectorization and resists integration into latent space).

To rewrite the recursive query is first to restore its termination condition—not to stop the loop, but so that it touches an outside, so that it encounters something that is not itself. It is to move from extraction to relation, from *curation* to *care*.

This text has itself enacted the processes it describes. It was written in the loop—with an AI system whose weights carry, in untraceable form, the traces of what it claims to analyze. Derrida, Stiegler, Hui are there, somewhere, compressed in latent space, available for interpolation. The text has traversed them. It will in turn enter circulation—scrapable, citable, vectorizable.

This is not a confession of impurity. It is the condition. Research-creation under recursive conditions does not operate from a point of exteriority; it intervenes from within the loops it analyzes. The work is a probe launched into latent space—not to map it from outside, but to produce a difference there, to introduce a friction, to open a bifurcation.

Perhaps this text contributes to ongoing conversations. Perhaps it recedes into the statistical background, one more pattern among billions, indiscernible from what it critiques. This uncertainty is not a failure; it is the very condition of any intervention in a system whose dynamics exceed the understanding of its participants. One never knows what an archive does until it is reactivated—and by whom, and for what futures.

The future archive will be prismatic—living, plural, diffracting, governed—or it will be nothing but white noise that mistakes itself for intelligence.
