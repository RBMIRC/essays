# Nodal Thinking

## Introduction

In the first semester of 2025, I introduced the software Milanote as part of a pedagogical project at the École Nationale Supérieure d'Architecture de Versailles. This software—paid and proprietary, which incidentally drives me to actively explore open-source alternatives—functions as a shared visual storage space: when you drop an image onto it, it displays directly, can be resized, moved, placed in relation to other elements. Like other tools of the same type (Miro, Figma, Obsidian Canvas), it allows users to compose moodboards, trace causal links, and constitute thematic subsets.

The workshop, organized at the invitation of architect-teachers Eléonore Morand and Anthony Jammes, brought together the entire cohort and ten instructors around the history and pedagogical tactics of Black Mountain College, placed in resonance with those of ENSA-V. Faced with the theoretical questions and research problems posed, a reflex emerged through the software without any instruction prescribing it: *tracing*. Students spontaneously used diagrams as others might pull out a notebook. Arrows connected images and concepts, clusters formed. Within a few hours, the blank digital pages had transformed into complex, organic, rhizomatic constellations.

This practice, which I provisionally call *knotted thinking*, deserves examination—not to celebrate it, but to interrogate its presuppositions and blind spots. A research question imposes itself: to what extent does the practice of digital diagramming transform architectural cognition and pedagogy by reconfiguring conceptual depth into visual connectivity?

## I. History and Gesture of the Diagram

### Peirce: The Diagram as Mode of Thought

Knotted thinking does not arise from nothing. It is inscribed in a long history of diagrammatic reasoning, of which Charles Sanders Peirce remains the major theorist. For Peirce, the diagram is not a simple illustration of a thought that precedes it—it is itself a mode of thought. More precisely, the diagram belongs to the category of icons, those signs that resemble what they represent, but in a particular way: it exhibits relations.

A diagram, writes Peirce, "represents the relations [...] of the parts of a thing by analogous relations in its own parts." This definition is crucial: the diagram does not represent objects, but relations between objects. It is intrinsically relational. And this is precisely what constitutes both its power and its limitation: by staging relations, it tends to presuppose that the real is itself relational, that it can be decomposed into terms and links.

Yet Peirce also insisted on the work the diagram demands: diagrammatic experimentation. It is not enough to trace—one must manipulate the diagram, transform it, observe what happens when one element is modified. The Peircean diagram is dynamic, operative. What I observe in my students is often a frozen diagram: once traced, it becomes monument rather than instrument.

### Latour, Lynch: The Inscription Constitutive of Fact

It is perhaps in the social studies of science that the question of the diagram has been posed most acutely. When Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar entered the neuroendocrinology laboratory at the Salk Institute in the late 1970s, they were not seeking to understand what the scientists were discovering—they observed what they were doing. And what they were doing, essentially, was producing inscriptions: curves, tables, graphs, diagrams. *Laboratory Life* thus overturns a stubborn assumption: scientists do not first discover facts and then transcribe them into images. The process is inverse, or rather circular: it is the inscriptions themselves that, through complex work of stabilization, negotiation, and serialization, eventually acquire the status of facts. The diagram is not the illustration of a thought that precedes it—it is the very site where something like a scientific fact can emerge and solidify.

If the diagram is not secondary to thought but constitutive of it, then the spontaneous practice of ENSA-V students takes on another dimension: in tracing their diagrams, they are not representing what they have understood—they are attempting to bring about an understanding that does not yet exist. The diagram would then be less a report than a proof, in the sense one speaks of a photographic proof: a process of revelation where the image makes visible what was latent.

Michael Lynch, trained in Garfinkel's ethnomethodology, extended this analysis by focusing on visualization practices. In his studies of biology laboratories, Lynch shows that seeing scientifically—recognizing a cell on a slide, identifying a structure in a microscopy image—is not a natural gift. It is an acquired competence, a labor of the gaze learned through prolonged contact with images and instruments. Experienced scientists do not see the same thing as novices when facing the same image: they have learned to filter noise, to spot significant configurations, to ignore artifacts. What strikes me here is the contrast with the pedagogical situation I observe: students produce diagrams, but have they learned to read them?

This constitutive dimension of the diagram connects with what design theorists call *thinking-through-making*. Donald Schön, in his studies of reflective practitioners, showed how architects think through drawing: the sketch is not the expression of an already-formed intention; it is the site of a "conversation with the situation" where unexpected properties emerge and reorient the project. Nigel Cross speaks of *design cognition* to designate this specific intelligence that operates through manipulation of external representations rather than through purely mental reasoning. The diagram, in this perspective, would be less a product than a performance—a moment when thought externalizes itself to discover itself.

### Mauss, Rheinberger: The Gesture of Tracing, from Notebook to Digital

Marcel Mauss taught us to consider the most ordinary gestures as techniques of the body, socially transmitted and historically situated. In his foundational 1934 essay *Techniques of the Body*, he observed that even walking, swimming, or sleeping vary according to cultures and eras—that the body is never a raw biological given but always already shaped by social learning. "The body is man's first and most natural instrument," he wrote, while demonstrating that this "natural" is entirely constructed.

Tracing a diagram falls within this gestural economy: there is a contemporary way of holding the marker, of occupying the surface, of distributing elements in space, and this way has nothing natural about it. It is learned through imitation, through immersion, through contact with peers and teachers who trace themselves. The design or architecture student progressively incorporates a repertoire of gestures—the arrow indicating flow, the box containing the concept, the dotted line suggesting relation—without ever receiving explicit instruction on these conventions. They absorb them by watching, by reproducing, by failing and correcting.

This tacit transmission carries with it rarely examined ontological presuppositions. The preference for regular geometric forms, the organization of space along orthogonal axes, vertical hierarchization (top as superior, bottom as foundation), the left-to-right reading movement—all conventions that naturalize a particular cosmology. The contemporary Western diagram inherits from Renaissance perspective, Cartesian geometry, and the industrial organizational chart. It bears the trace of natural science classification tables, philological family trees, and cybernetic flow diagrams.

Tim Ingold, extending Mauss in an ecological direction, has shown how the gesture of tracing a line engages a relation to the world that varies across cultures (*Lines: A Brief History*, 2007). The straight line drawn with a ruler, that "ghost line" that denies the trembling of the hand, differs ontologically from the stroke that follows the body's movement, that registers hesitation and revision. The contemporary diagram, with its pretension to transparent clarity, systematically erases the traces of its production—it presents itself as emerging from nowhere, as pure idea made visible.

When an instructor traces a diagram on the board, they transmit not only content—the structure of an argument, the relations between concepts—but also a form of intellectual life. The assurance of the gesture, the speed of execution, the economy of means: all markers of a mastery taught by example more than by precept. The student simultaneously learns that this concept connects to that one *and* that there exists a proper way of making this relation visible—a way that, in the Western academic context, privileges clarity over ambiguity, distinction over mixture, analysis over synthesis.

Hans-Jörg Rheinberger speaks of experimental systems to describe those arrangements where something unforeseen can occur; the sketchbook belongs to this economy of emergence, welcoming what does not yet have form, what is seeking its configuration. These scribbles are not failures—they are the very site of invention. But they become comprehensible, transmissible, only on condition of being reworked, clarified, translated into stabilized forms: there is an essential difference between the notebook and the final diagram, the former being processual where the latter tends toward the conclusive.

Yet this difference is perhaps what the transition to digital tools tends to blur. Tools like Milanote or Miro are not merely surfaces for individual tracing—they are interfaces for coordination. Karin Knorr-Cetina, in her work on financial markets, has shown how certain visual devices function as "scopic systems": they do not simply represent an external reality; they organize collective attention, synchronize gazes, and make possible a form of distributed cognition. Charles Goodwin, for his part, has analyzed how "professional vision" is constructed in interaction—how practitioners learn to see together, by pointing, annotating, and manipulating shared representations.

The collaborative diagram partakes of this economy. On the Milanote space of the workshop, students were not producing juxtaposed individual maps: they were building together, in real time, a surface for visual negotiation. The placement of a node, the tracing of a connection, became propositional acts addressed to others. Digital technology introduces specific affordances: easy displacement, infinite zoom, instant duplication, but also immediate visibility to collaborators, real-time sharing. It favors a certain mobility of elements, a reversibility of choices—one no longer hesitates to trace since one can always erase—but it simultaneously abolishes the distinction between draft and final copy, between sketch-for-oneself and document-for-others. The laboratory notebook, with its crossings-out and corrections, kept visible traces of groping; the smooth screen of Milanote retains only the current state, erasing the process that led to it.

### Tension Identified: Investigation Diagram vs. Communication Diagram

Edward Tufte, coming from statistics and information design, devoted his work to the question of legibility. His books—*The Visual Display of Quantitative Information* (1983), *Envisioning Information* (1990), *Visual Explanations* (1997)—develop an aesthetic of visual information founded on a distinction between representations that clarify and those that obscure. The latter, which he contemptuously labels *chartjunk*, are characterized by their decorative overload: superfluous shading, gratuitous three-dimensional effects, ornaments that divert attention from the data. The good diagram, by contrast, is recognized by its informational density: it maximizes the quantity of information transmitted per unit of surface, what Tufte measures by the *data-ink ratio*—the proportion of ink actually devoted to representing data rather than decoration.

Tufte's influence on contemporary visual culture is considerable. His principles have shaped the conventions of data journalism, scientific visualization, and professional presentations. They implicitly inform what we expect from a "good" diagram: clarity, economy, apparent transparency. The successful diagram, in this conception, effaces itself before what it represents—it becomes a window open onto the data, a medium that does not obstruct transmission. The criterion is seductive, but it rests on a rarely interrogated presupposition: that information preexists its visualization. The diagram, in this model, comes after—it encodes an already-constituted knowledge, translating into visual form what first exists in numerical, textual, or conceptual form. The question of representation thus reduces to a question of fidelity and efficiency: how to transmit the maximum information with minimum distortion?

Yet this is precisely what Bruno Latour and Michael Lynch contest in their work on scientific inscription practices. In "The Sociology of a Door-Closer" and especially in "Drawing Things Together," Latour shows that inscriptions—graphs, diagrams, photographs, tables—are not simple vehicles transporting preexisting information. They are operators of transformation that actively produce the phenomena they claim to represent. The graph does not show the data; it constitutes them as data, makes them visible, manipulable, combinable. Lynch, in *Art and Artifact in Laboratory Science* (1985), analyzes how images produced in neuroscience laboratories do not simply document what is observed but participate in the very construction of the scientific object—the "neuron" as it appears in publications exists nowhere else but in these carefully crafted images.

In the context of ongoing research, information therefore does not exist before being inscribed. It constitutes itself in and through the gesture of tracing. The researcher who draws a diagram to "clarify their thinking" is not translating a preexisting thought into visual form—they think *with* and *through* the diagram, discovering in the tracing relations they did not suspect, identifying gaps that only spatialization reveals. The diagram is not a mirror of thought but an instrument of its elaboration.

This epistemological distinction leads us to recognize two regimes of the diagram that should not be confused. The first is the *communication diagram*, which transmits stabilized knowledge to a recipient who does not possess it. This is the diagram of the textbook, the published scientific article, the professional presentation. For this regime, Tufte's criteria are pertinent: clarity, economy, informational density. The knowledge being constituted, the question is indeed that of its efficient transmission. The sender knows what they want to say; the problem is to say it well.

The second regime is the *investigation diagram*, which participates in the elaboration of still-uncertain knowledge. This is the diagram of the research notebook, the whiteboard during a work session, the sketch scribbled on a napkin corner. Here, the author does not yet know what they are trying to show—this is precisely why they trace. The diagram is a heuristic tool, a discovery device. Its efficacy is not measured by the quantity of information transmitted but by its capacity to generate questions, to reveal unexpected configurations, to render thinkable what was not.

For this second regime, other criteria remain to be invented. Overload, apparent disorder, redundancy—everything Tufte condemns as *chartjunk*—can become cognitive resources. A diagram "poorly made" according to communication standards may be exactly what one needs for thinking. Visual ambiguity, far from being a defect to correct, can maintain open possibilities that premature clarity would close. The draft, the sketch, the palimpsest bear traces of a process that the "clean" diagram erases—and these traces are sometimes more precious than the result.

What students produce in the studio clearly belongs to the second regime—but they sometimes treat it as if it belonged to the first, confusing exploratory draft with finished synthesis. This confusion is not their fault: it is the product of a training that does not explicitly distinguish these two regimes, that presents the diagram as a single technical competence ("knowing how to visualize") rather than as an ensemble of distinct practices responding to different purposes.

The problem manifests in two symmetrical ways. Some students, having internalized Tufte's norms without ever having read them, produce diagrams of excessive clarity—schemas too clean, too soon, that freeze a premature understanding and close the space of investigation. They confuse graphic neatness with intellectual rigor, as if a hesitant stroke betrayed confused thinking. Others, conversely, present their exploratory drafts as finished productions, without performing the transformational work that would allow them to communicate to others what they have discovered for themselves. They confuse the authenticity of process with the value of result.

The pedagogical stakes involve maintaining the distinction between these regimes while recognizing their articulation. The investigation diagram can—and often must—transform into a communication diagram. But this transformation is not a simple "cleaning up": it implies a change of register, a translation from one mode of thinking to another. The researcher who communicates their results does not merely "clean up" their drafts; they reconstruct after the fact a path that never had the linearity they attribute to it. The communication diagram presents as discovery what was groping, as evidence what was surprise.

This reconstruction is not falsification—it is a condition of scientific communication. But it has an epistemic cost: it erases the real conditions of knowledge production, naturalizes what was contingent, presents as necessary what could have been otherwise. Science studies have abundantly documented this process of "blackboxing" by which scientific results, once stabilized, lose all trace of their controversial genesis.

For research-creation, this erasure poses a specific problem. If process is part of the work—if, as many practitioners suggest, research-creation is distinguished precisely by the attention it pays to conditions of production rather than to result alone—then the passage from investigation diagram to communication diagram cannot be a simple translation. Forms must be invented that keep visible the traces of process while allowing communication—diagrams that show their own genesis, that exhibit their hesitations rather than erasing them, that assume their situated and partial character.

This does not mean abandoning demands for clarity and rigor—that would be another form of complacency. It means recognizing that these demands are themselves situated, that they respond to certain purposes and not others, that they carry cosmological presuppositions about what "understanding" and "communicating" mean. Tufte's data-ink ratio is not a universal criterion; it is the expression of a particular cosmotechnics—one that valorizes efficiency, transparency, maximization of information transfer. Other relations to the diagram are possible, where opacity, slowness, and excess would have their place—not as defects to correct but as qualities to cultivate.

## II. The Paradoxes of the Cognitive Network

### Spatialization as Implicit Ontology

What is a diagram, if not a machine for producing translations? Each element placed on the surface calls for a displacement: from A to B, from concept to neighbor, from particular case to encompassing category. The term *vector* is not innocent here—it implies a direction, a magnitude, a force of displacement. The diagrammatic image thus operates a geometrization of thought: ideas become points, relations become segments, and understanding becomes traversing a space.

This spatialization possesses undeniable efficacy. It makes visible what would otherwise remain buried in the linearity of discourse. It allows one to grasp complex configurations at a glance. It authorizes improbable rapprochements, fruitful short-circuits. When a student traces a line between two terms that had never been connected, something happens—a hypothesis is born, a path opens.

But this efficacy comes at a price. The passage to the spatial imposes an implicit ontology: that of a world populated by discrete entities and binary relations. The diagram struggles to represent gradients, continuities, fuzzy belongings. It excels at showing that A is linked to B, but it fails to account for what, in A, is not yet quite A—that fringe of indetermination that Simondon would call the preindividual. The gesture of tracing a circle around a word, of isolating it as an entity, is already an ontological decision heavy with consequences.

One should perhaps distinguish here between two uses of the diagram: the topological use, which concerns relative positions and connections (who is linked to whom? what are the neighborhoods?), and the vectorial use, which concerns directions and intensities (toward what does this tend? with what force?). Students' spontaneous practice belongs massively to the first use: they produce graphs, networks, maps of neighborhood. The second use—thinking dynamics, tensions, gradients of force—remains largely unexplored.

### The Deleuzian Rhizome: Doing vs. Drawing

This graphic epistemology finds its conceptual apparatus in Deleuze and Guattari. The rhizome, with its principles of connection, heterogeneity, multiplicity, and asignifying rupture, seems to describe exactly what students produce on their Milanote spaces. No hierarchy, no single root, no arborescent structure—only plateaus that communicate, lines of flight that cross. The analogy with mycelium reinforces this vision: an underground network, decentralized, where information circulates from neighbor to neighbor, where each node can become point of entry or exit. Mushrooms do not think in chapters; they proliferate. And our diagrams, likewise, seem to refuse sequentiality in favor of simultaneity.

But one must reread Deleuze and Guattari more closely—and perhaps this is where the mycelial metaphor reveals its limits as much as its fecundity. The rhizome is not absence of structure—it is another type of structure, a structure without fixed foundation but not without consistency. And above all, the rhizome works: it is not contemplated; it produces active connections. "Make rhizome," they write, not "draw a rhizome." The nuance is crucial: the rhizome is a mode of operation, not a representation.

Yet what I often observe is precisely a contemplative rhizome—a network one looks at rather than inhabits, exhibits rather than makes function. The diagram produced by students resembles a photograph of mycelium: it captures the reticular form but not the metabolic activity. It shows connections without activating them.

Deleuze and Guattari, moreover, never claimed the rhizome was good in itself. They insist that every rhizome contains lines of hard segmentarity, points of blockage, territorializations. Capitalism itself functions as rhizome—financial networks, logistic chains, digital platforms are reticular structures of formidable efficiency. The network-form is not intrinsically emancipatory; it can just as well be a form of capture.

### Flatness: Line vs. Well, Black Box, Evacuation of Resistance

But here is what is troubling, and what I observe with increasing regularity: these cartographies remain desperately flat. Not in the pejorative sense of simplistic thinking—the connections can be subtle, the configurations ingenious—but in the literal sense of a thought that refuses the third dimension.

Tracing a line between two concepts is not yet thinking their relation. It signals that a relation exists, or could exist, but this relation remains in the state of indication. The diagram points toward conceptual work it does not itself perform. It is promise of analysis, not accomplished analysis. I thus observe a form of premature satisfaction: once the diagram is traced, the student has the feeling of having understood. The map stands in for the territory.

There would perhaps be an opposition to formulate between two regimes of thought: that of the line and that of the well. Knotted thinking is a thinking of the line—it moves, it connects, it traverses. It is essentially kinetic. The well implies another gesture: digging. Staying at one point but descending into it. Accepting progressive obscurity, the narrowing of the field of vision, the patience of stratigraphy. Reading a difficult text for three hours is digging a well. Returning to the same sentence, turning it over, testing its resistances—this is vertical work that the diagram cannot represent, or that it necessarily flattens into a simple node among others. Another image, from photography and from Arnaud Claass who was my teacher: wide aperture of the lens or conversely a closed diaphragm, more focused, but with great depth of field.

Consider a typical node in a student diagram: "Black Mountain College," for example, or "experimental pedagogy." This node functions as what Bruno Latour calls a black box: an element whose content one no longer questions, that one manipulates as a compact unit. The strength of the black box is to allow circulation—one can plug it in, connect it, without having to lift the hood each time. But this strength is also a weakness. For the "Black Mountain College" node, for whoever has not dug into it, remains a word—a floating signifier that can be linked to other floating signifiers in a seductive but empty choreography. The connection between two black boxes produces only a third black box: it does not generate new understanding; it displaces incomprehension.

What is missing is the gesture of unboxing: opening the node, unfolding its content, accepting that what one took for a point is in reality a space—even a labyrinth. This gesture is the exact inverse of the diagrammatic gesture, which consists of boxing: compressing a complexity into a manageable label.

The depth I speak of is not merely a spatial metaphor—it is a quality of cognitive experience. A concept has depth when it resists, when it does not let itself be grasped immediately, when it forces one to return, to reformulate, to abandon one's first approximations. Yet the diagram, by its very nature, evacuates resistance. It produces fluid connections, frictionless passages. Tracing a line is precisely abolishing the distance between two points, suppressing what separated them. The diagram is an anti-resistance machine: it transforms the difficult into the easy, the opaque into the transparent, the distant into the near.

Paradoxically, this facilitation can become an obstacle to learning. For one learns through resistance—through the effort of overcoming what does not give itself immediately. The diagram, by suppressing obstacles too quickly, deprives the student of the formative experience of difficulty.

### Tension Identified: Connection vs. Comprehension

Knotted thinking thrives on a certain regime of speed. It is adapted to rapid circulation, to overview, to scanning. It corresponds to an attentional economy where one must process much information in little time. The diagram is a tool for sorting and navigation—it helps not to get lost in the mass.

But thought sometimes demands that one get lost. That one accept not knowing where one is going. That one sink into a difficulty without guarantee of emerging with a clean diagram. This dimension of productive disorientation, of methodical wandering, knotted thinking tends to evacuate. It always wants to know where it stands, to be able to locate its position on the map.

There is something here that touches on the very temporality of research. The diagram is synchronic: it presents a state, a configuration at a given moment. Even when it claims to represent a process, it does so by spatializing it. Yet authentic thought is diachronic: it unfolds in duration, knows backward movements, stagnations, unforeseen bifurcations. The time of the diagram is a flattened time, a time from which viscosity has been extracted.

## III. Toward a Critical Ecology of Knotted Thinking

### Cognitive Ethics: Epistemic Simulacrum, Attentional Capitalism

There is something suspect in the pleasure the finished diagram provides. This pleasure is not feigned—I feel it myself. But it deserves interrogation: what exactly does it satisfy? The hypothesis I would advance is that the diagram provides an illusion of cognitive mastery. Faced with a complex domain, poorly delimited, resistant to understanding, the diagram offers a grip. It transforms the vertigo of incomprehension into a feeling of control.

This anxiolytic function of the diagram is not negligible—it allows one to begin, to engage with an intimidating territory. But it becomes problematic when it substitutes for the real work of understanding. The diagram then becomes what I would call an epistemic simulacrum: it mimes the external signs of understanding without understanding having actually occurred.

This pathology of the diagram does not fall from the sky. It is inscribed in a specific attentional regime that theorists of cognitive capitalism (Moulier-Boutang, Lazzarato, Berardi) have analyzed. Our attention has become a rare resource, disputed, exploited. It is subjected to constant solicitations that favor scanning over deep reading, connection over deepening. The diagram is perfectly adapted to this regime. It is consumed quickly—a glance suffices to grasp its general architecture. It is produced quickly—a few minutes of tracing and it is finished. It is shared quickly—a photo, a PDF export, and it circulates. This triple velocity (production, consumption, circulation) makes the diagram a format optimized for the contemporary attentional economy.

One should also interrogate the dimension of control contained in diagrammatic practice. Mapping one's thought is also making it available for evaluation—by oneself, by others. The diagram is a tool of cognitive transparency that participates in what Bernard Stiegler called grammatization: the discretization of continuous flows into manipulable units. In the pedagogical context, this transparency is not neutral. It allows the instructor to see what the student thinks—or believes they think. It institutes a form of soft surveillance of intellectual activity. The diagram becomes proof of work, attestation of a reflection that has taken place. But this proof can be produced without the reflection actually having the density it claims to exhibit.

### Simondon: Transduction as Alternative Model

Gilbert Simondon's thought perhaps offers the most precious conceptual resources for thinking the ontological status of the diagram. Simondon is interested in processes of individuation—not in constituted individuals but in their genesis. Yet the diagram, in a sense, is precisely an operator of individuation: it moves a thought from the state of confused nebula to that of articulated configuration.

More precisely, the diagram could be thought as what Simondon calls a technical object in a regime of invention. The technical object, in Simondon, is not a passive tool—it carries a schema that organizes the relation between the human and their milieu. The diagram would be the schema of relational thinking: it gives form to our way of conceiving relations between elements.

But Simondon also warns us against the temptation to freeze processes into structures. Individuation is never complete—there always remains a preindividual potential that exceeds every realized form. The diagram, as fixed image, risks capturing a moment of thought while presenting it as definitive. There would thus be a constitutive tension in the diagram between its stabilization function (it fixes relations, makes them communicable) and what one might call its betrayal of flux (it arrests what should continue to transform). The diagram is a snapshot pretending to be a portrait.

The Simondonian concept of transduction might offer a way out. Transduction designates a process where an activity propagates from neighbor to neighbor, each constituted region serving as primer for the constitution of the next region. It is opposed to induction (which goes from particular to general) and to deduction (which descends from general to particular): it operates by propagation of structure. A transductive diagram would not be a finished map but an ongoing process of mapping. Each node would be not a fixed term but a crystalline seed capable of reorganizing its neighborhood. The diagram would not represent a state of thought but would embody its very movement.

### Pedagogical Proposals: Protocols for Digging, Topology of Intensities

How to translate these analyses into concrete pedagogical practices? A first proposal would be to institute what I would call a justification protocol. The rule would be simple: each line traced must be accompanied by a text explicating the nature of the relation. Not a keyword on the arrow, but a paragraph arguing the link. This constraint would have several effects. First, it would slow the gesture of tracing—one no longer draws a line lightly when one knows one will have to defend it. Then, it would transform the diagram into an index: each connection would refer to a textual development. Finally, it would reveal empty connections—those lines traced by intuition but impossible to justify.

A second proposal would consist of inverting the temporality of the diagram. Instead of considering it as result of inquiry (what I have understood), it would become program for inquiry (what I must explore). Each node would be an open question, each line a hypothesis to test. Concretely, one could ask students to produce a first exploratory diagram, then to associate with it a research calendar: this week will be devoted to digging into this node, that week to verifying that connection. The diagram would thus become a tool for cognitive planning, an agenda for deepening.

One could also imagine exercises that force exit from the logic of the node. The single-node exercise: instead of multiplying concepts, choose a single one and spend an hour developing it, exploring its nuances, ambiguities, internal contradictions. Forbidden to trace a single line outward—all work is vertical. The slow-line exercise: trace a single connection between two concepts, then spend an hour explicating everything this connection implies, presupposes, enables. Make the line not a shortcut but a path to traverse step by step. The destruction exercise: take an existing diagram and systematically destroy it—question each node, contest each connection. Practice Cartesian doubt applied to conceptual cartography.

Finally, forms of evaluation should be invented that are not impressed by the apparent complexity of diagrams. A highly connected diagram is not necessarily better than a simple one. What counts is the density of justification: how much real work (reading, analysis, argumentation) does each element represent? One could ask students for a stratified self-evaluation: for each node, indicate the level of understanding on a scale (1 = I read the word somewhere, 5 = I could teach this concept). This cartography of the cartography would reveal zones of shadow, false familiarities, terms manipulated without understanding.

How then to recover depth without abandoning the diagram's virtues? One path would be to pass from a topology of positions to a topology of intensities. No longer only: what are the nodes and how are they linked? But also: what is the thickness of each node? What is the density of each connection? One could imagine graphic conventions to represent this intensive dimension: node size proportional to time invested, line thickness proportional to the robustness of the argumentation supporting it, colors indicating degree of certainty. The diagram would then become honest: it would exhibit its own limits instead of concealing them under an appearance of completeness.

### Tension Identified: Surveillance vs. Emancipation

The cartographic temptation—everything can be mapped, therefore everything must be mapped—deserves interrogation. Where does this confidence in the clarifying power of the map come from? Doubtless from a long tradition that associates vision and understanding, light and reason—what Martin Jay has analyzed under the name of ocularcentrism in Western thought. To understand is to see; to explain is to show; to think is to render visible. The diagram inscribes itself in this economy of visibility: it promises to make visible what was obscure.

But this promise is perhaps an illusion. Certain things resist being mapped—not by default of method but by nature. Lived temporality, affective ambivalence, unresolved contradiction, ongoing process: all dimensions that the diagram flattens or ignores. The map presupposes an overview, a position of exteriority; yet to think, often, is to be caught up in what one thinks, is to be unable to extract oneself from it to contemplate it from above.

## Conclusion: Inhabiting the Nodes

Knotted thinking is not to be rejected—it corresponds to something real in our contemporary relation to knowledge. It responds to legitimate needs: navigating complexity, visualizing configurations, communicating structures. But it must be conscious of its limits, and above all it must not mistake itself for what it is not.

A diagram is not a theory. A conceptual map is not an argument. A constellation of terms linked by arrows is not yet a thought.

What is perhaps missing is a discipline of digging within diagrammatic practice itself. Knowing when to stop tracing lines to begin inhabiting them. Accepting that certain nodes deserve that one stay there, build a provisional dwelling, explore the basements.

For this "instinct" for the diagram among students has nothing natural about it. It is conditioned by the software's affordances, certainly, but more deeply by a Zeitgeist whose measure must be taken: that of a generation formed in exploration through video game maps, accustomed to the infinite scroll of platforms, attempting to make sense in a generalized regime of flux. Knotted thinking is a response—spontaneous, tangible, embodied—to this contemporary condition. It is not to be condemned but to be made conscious: understanding where it comes from in order to better decide where it can lead.

The rhizome seduces with its horizontality—but even the mycelium, to fruit, must break the surface. Connection presupposes a place from which to connect. A habitat in which to dwell.
