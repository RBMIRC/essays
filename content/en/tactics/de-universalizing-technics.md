## Abstract

The encounter between contemporary European artistic practice and non-Western philosophies poses an ethical and epistemological problem that goodwill alone cannot resolve. The gesture of "openness"—that emblem of liberal cosmopolitanism—may constitute the subtlest form of extraction: presupposing that all knowledge systems are equally accessible to all subjects, that the properly cultivated mind can access and synthesize any tradition. This essay argues for an alternative approach: not the incorporation of other cosmologies into European practice, but rather the de-universalization of European technics as a precondition for genuine plurality. It further proposes a set of citational practices for distinguishing legitimate engagement with non-Western thought from extractive appropriation.

## The Problem of Universality

The concept of cosmotechnics developed by Hong Kong philosopher Yuk Hui—the unification of cosmic order and moral order through technical activities—does not primarily invite Western practitioners to borrow from Chinese, Amazonian, or African technical traditions. Its critical force lies elsewhere: it reveals that Western technology, which presents itself as culturally neutral and universally valid, is in reality only one cosmotechnics among others. The Promethean technics inherited from Greek thought, passing through Christian eschatology and Enlightenment rationalism, carries specific cosmological commitments: nature as standing-reserve, time as linear progress, the human as rational agent of transformation.

These commitments are not recognized as cosmological. They pass for "absence of cosmology"—for pure reason, scientific method, technological necessity. This is the hegemonic operation: one particular cosmotechnics occupies the position of universality, against which all others appear as local, traditional, or pre-modern variations. As Pieter Lemmens observes in *Cosmotechnics: For a Renewed Concept of Technology in the Anthropocene* (*Angelaki: New Work in the Theoretical Humanities*, co-edited with Hui, 2020), Hui's project challenges the universality still present in Heidegger, Simondon, and Stiegler, proposing instead a radical cosmotechnical pluralism—a technodiversity.

The gesture of incorporating elements from "other" traditions into European practice, however well-intentioned, risks reproducing this structure. Non-Western thought becomes raw material for Western artistic production—yet another resource to extract, transform, and exhibit. When thinking about relations with artificial intelligences outside imposed schemas, vigilance is required.

## The Critique of Epistemic Extractivism

Recent scholarship has refined the critique of what Ramón Grosfoguel (2019) calls "epistemic extractivism"—the appropriation of knowledge from marginalized communities by researchers operating within dominant institutional frameworks. Aymara sociologist Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui has been particularly incisive in her critique. In *Ch'ixinakax utxiwa: On Decolonising Practices and Discourses*, she writes that through citational practices, hierarchies are structured such that indigenous intellectuals end up consuming "in regurgitated form, the very ideas about decolonization" that they had independently produced.

Rivera Cusicanqui's critique extends to decolonial theory itself. As she provocatively stated in an interview with Veronica Gago: "The postcolonial is a desire, the anticolonial is a struggle, the decolonial is an unbearable fashionable neologism." Her point is not that decolonial studies lack value, but that the academic appropriation of radical concepts without corresponding political engagement depoliticizes and domesticates them. Knowledge circulates from South to North, is processed by the metropolitan academic machinery, and returns in forms that often marginalize its creators.

A 2025 special issue of the *International Journal of the Sociology of Language* devoted to "Decolonizing Decoloniality" reinforces this concern, noting that appropriation by decolonial scholars has sometimes diluted radical politics into what Rivera Cusicanqui calls a "fashionable, depoliticized, and comfortable multiculturalism" that leaves imperial structures intact. The danger is that through citation games and canonical legitimation, ideas originating in the South are re-circulated to Southern scholars in mediated form, "effectively recolonizing the imaginaries and minds of Southern intellectuals."

## The Reflexive Turn

The alternative is not to look outward but to turn reflexively inward: to make visible the cosmological presuppositions already inscribed in one's own practice, tools, and institutional situation. This is not a retreat into provincialism but its opposite—a precondition for genuine dialogue. As long as European technics occupies the unmarked position of universality, no authentic encounter with other cosmotechnics is possible. There is only appropriation, translation into dominant terms, or exoticization.

For an artist working within European institutions, with European training, using technologies developed within Western industrial and scientific frameworks, the rigorous move is to recognize this situation as constitutive rather than incidental. The work does not transcend its conditions; it operates from within while refusing their claim to transcendence.

This reflexive turn involves several operations:

First, one must name the apparatus. The tools of contemporary artistic practice—digital technologies, exhibition formats, critical vocabularies, funding structures—carry cosmological freight. The computational systems we employ embody specific ontologies: discrete states, binary logic, optimization toward defined objectives. The gallery space enacts a particular relationship between object, viewer, and context. The research framework presupposes certain epistemic norms. Making all this visible is already a gesture of denaturalization.

Second, one must historicize the universal. The categories structuring artistic practice—creativity, expression, innovation, critique—have genealogies. They emerged from specific historical configurations and bear their traces. To historicize them is to reveal their contingency, to show that other configurations were and remain possible.

Third, one must acknowledge the limit. There are cosmologies to which I have no authentic access. I cannot practice from within traditions I have not inherited and with which I have no lived relationship. This is not a failure but a condition. Honest recognition of this limit is more ethical than the pretense of universal availability.

## The Ethics of Citation: Engaging Without Extracting

Given these constraints, how can a European practitioner legitimately engage with non-Western thought? The question demands careful distinction between different modes of citational practice.

### Citing Thinkers Versus Claiming Cosmologies

There is a crucial difference between engaging with philosophers who work from or theorize other cosmotechnics, and claiming to practice from within cosmologies one does not inhabit. One can read and cite Yuk Hui's analysis of Chinese cosmotechnics without claiming to do Chinese cosmotechnics. The engagement is philosophical and critical, not performative or appropriative. Similarly, one can engage with Eduardo Viveiros de Castro's theorization of Amerindian perspectivism as a critique of Western ontology without claiming to practice multinaturalism.

This distinction matters because certain thinkers explicitly position themselves as interlocutors with Western thought. Hui's work addresses a global philosophical conversation; it performs translation work. Citing such work differs from direct extraction from traditions that have not offered themselves to this exchange.

### Citing for Critique Versus Citing for Content

The purpose of citation matters. One can cite non-Western thinkers for their critique of Western universalism—using their work as leverage to reveal the limits and presuppositions of one's own tradition—without extracting their concepts as content to fill one's own practice. Viveiros de Castro's multinaturalism helps expose the implicit mononaturalism of Western science; one need not claim to practice Amerindian perspectivism to learn from this critical operation.

This approach aligns with what Adom Getachew and Karuna Mantena, writing in the journal *Critical Times* (2021), call for in decolonizing political theory: an engagement with anticolonial thought that takes seriously "the specific problem-spaces of non-Western thinkers" rather than treating them as additions to a Western canon. Their concern is that decolonial engagements "remain too centered on Western political thought as the object of critique and analysis." The alternative is to understand anticolonial and non-Western thought on its own terms, with its own reconstructive agenda.

### Marking One's Reading Position

When citing across epistemic difference, one can mark how one reads: "Reading Hui from the European situation he critiques..." or "Glissant's concept of opacity, which I encounter as a European reader and cannot fully inhabit, nevertheless..." This acknowledges the asymmetry of the encounter rather than feigning universal access. It situates the reader as reader, not as practitioner of what is read.

---

## The Question of Opacity

Édouard Glissant's concept of the "right to opacity" (*le droit à l'opacité*) offers a theoretical resource for thinking this limit. As Benjamin P. Davis explains in a 2023 article for *Critical Legal Thinking*, opacity in Glissant is an ethical and political claim against the Western imperative to "understand" others—where understanding means not only hearing but grasping and controlling. The right to opacity insists that difference need not be rendered transparent, that relation does not require total mutual intelligibility.

For the European practitioner engaging with non-Western thought, respecting opacity means accepting that certain dimensions of other cosmotechnics will remain inaccessible—not as a failure of scholarship but as a condition of ethical relation. As Glissant writes in *Poetics of Relation*: "In order to understand and thus accept you, I have to measure your solidity with the ideal scale providing me with grounds to make comparisons and, perhaps, judgments. I have to reduce." The alternative to reduction is not ignorance but a relation that does not require total transparency.

As Devarya Srivastava writes, opacity in Glissant should be understood not as a barrier to overcome through better methodology but as "an ethico-political stance for and in favour of unknowability." In contrast to the illusion of transparency that demands reducing the density of the difference the Other presents, opacity names what exceeds the doctrine of universal intelligibility. This has implications for any practice seeking to engage across difference: total knowledge of the other is neither possible nor desirable; what is possible is a relation that respects the other's irreducibility (SRIVASTAVA, 2023).

## From Globalization to Planetarity

Yuk Hui distinguishes between globalization—the homogenization of the world under a single technics—and planetarity—the coexistence of multiple cosmotechnics in non-hierarchical relation. The contribution of situated European practice to planetarity is not to incorporate other traditions but to vacate the universal position. By particularizing itself, by revealing its own cosmological commitments as particular rather than neutral, it makes room—conceptually and politically—for other cosmotechnics to exist on their own terms.

This is a genuinely difficult operation because it requires relinquishing epistemic privilege without falling into relativism. The claim is not that all knowledge systems are equally valid for all purposes, but that criteria of validity are themselves cosmologically situated. Different cosmotechnics may be adequate to different relations with the world, different conceptions of what it means to live well, different responses to the planetary crisis that is itself the product of one cosmotechnics' claim to universality.

As EL Putnam demonstrates in a 2023 article for the journal *Arts*, art can "introduce differencing into technology and technics, introducing cracks into one-world ontologies." Analyzing three Irish artworks that ambivalently engage technological infrastructures—from civil war archives to contemporary data centers—Putnam draws on Yuk Hui's concept of cosmotechnics to challenge the presupposition of a universal technē of Greek origin. If "scientific and technical thinking emerges under cosmological conditions that are expressed in the relations between humans and their milieus" (HUI, 2016, p. 18), then each culture potentially possesses its own cosmotechnics.

Art, in this sense, enables what Catherine Walsh calls "decolonial cracks," opening means of working and thinking otherwise with technology—not to synthesize all cosmotechnics into a new universal, but to create space for coexistence. This is what Arturo Escobar calls "ontological design for the pluriverse": "a means to think about, and contribute to, the transition from the hegemony of modernity's one-world ontology to a pluriverse of socionatural configurations" (ESCOBAR, 2018, p. 29). The task is not to replace one dominant ontology with another, but to multiply the possible.

## Implications for Practice

What does this mean concretely for artistic practice and its discursive framing in the context of research-creation?

It suggests first that artistic statements should not gesture toward an abstract openness to other cultures—which flattens difference in the liberal marketplace of ideas. They should rather specify the cosmological heritage from which the work operates and acknowledge the limits that heritage imposes.

Engagement with non-Western thinkers should be framed precisely. One must distinguish: the use of conceptual tools drawn from their critical analyses, which is legitimate; critical leverage against one's own tradition, which is also legitimate; legitimation of one's practice through exotic reference, which is problematic; extraction of content to fill one's work, which constitutes appropriation.

This also suggests that when citing across epistemic difference, one should explicitly mark one's reading position, engage with thinkers who have positioned themselves as interlocutors, use concepts for critique rather than appropriating them as content, respect the opacity of what cannot be fully accessed, and attend to the material and institutional conditions of citation itself.

Finally, it demands a certain modesty: the recognition that the de-universalization of European technics is a contribution to planetarity, but only one contribution among others that must come from elsewhere, from practitioners with different heritages and different relations to the crisis of our present.

## Situated Engagement Across Difference

The preceding arguments require specification. As a researcher and artist trained in French and European institutions, but bearing Vietnamese heritage, how can one inhabit this liminal position without resolving it into a stable identity? The question is not abstract: it structures the daily practice of research-creation.

My Vietnamese heritage is not a cosmological resource I can simply mobilize. I have no access to my ancestors' language, nor to ritual practices, nor to the technical knowledge that would constitute a Vietnamese cosmotechnics in Hui's sense. What I have is a structuring absence—what Glissant might call an opacity turned toward oneself. I cannot claim to speak from within a Vietnamese tradition; I can only recognize that the European tradition from which I actually speak does not exhaust what I am.

This intermediate position—neither fully European nor authentically Vietnamese—might seem an epistemic weakness. I propose it is rather a critical resource. It makes naive identification with European universalism impossible: I know intimately that this universal has always been particular, that it constituted itself through exclusion. But it also forbids the inverse gesture—the claim to radical alterity that would legitimate my speech through its supposed exteriority.

What this position enables is a particular form of attention to fissures. When I engage Yuk Hui's thought on Chinese cosmotechnics, I do not do so as a European discovering the Other, nor as an Asian recovering a lost tradition. I do so as someone for whom the question of technical plurality is not only theoretical but biographical—someone whose very existence testifies that traditions are never pure, that transmissions are always interrupted, that heritages recompose in unforeseen configurations.

Concretely, this means my engagement with non-European thought proceeds through acknowledgment of debt rather than appropriation. When I mobilize Glissant's concept of opacity, I do not claim access to the Caribbean experience of creolization. I use his concept as a tool for thinking my own situation—that of a researcher working with archives, with technical memory, with conditions of transmission, who knows that something in his own genealogy resists transparency. Opacity, for me, is not only a concept: it is the texture of my relation to part of my history.

Similarly, when I engage Latin American decolonial thought—Mignolo, Escobar, the tradition of *colonialidad del poder*—I do so recognizing that Southeast Asia has its own colonial history, its own thinkers, its own critical elaborations that I know poorly.

This position also implies limits. There are bodies of work with which I cannot engage in the same way—not through moral prohibition, but through epistemic honesty. The theoretical elaborations emerging from African American experience, for example, respond to a specific history of racial dehumanization that I have not lived. I can learn from these thoughts, be transformed by them, cite them with respect—but I cannot inhabit them. The right to opacity functions in both directions here: it protects the other's irreducibility, but it also reminds me of the limits of my own understanding.

What emerges from this reflection is not a general methodology but a situational ethics. Each engagement across epistemic difference must be negotiated singularly, according to specific relational histories, institutional positions, debts, and heritages. Research-creation, in this framework, is not the application of a pre-existing theory but the patient elaboration of a practice that assumes its partiality—that knows it can only contribute to planetarity by first recognizing the limits of its own situation.

### Positional Asymmetries

Different bodies of thought present different citational situations, and each demands attention to the particular relational structure of the encounter. Two examples, chosen because they traverse contemporary debates on technology and speculation, illustrate this demand—without claiming to exhaust possible configurations.

*Afrofuturism* emerges from a specific history of dispossession—the theft of African futures through the Middle Passage, the exclusion of Black subjects from technological modernity, the reappropriation of speculation as a site of liberation. As Kodwo Eshun argues in "Further Considerations on Afrofuturism" (2003), it constitutes a counter-memory project that "goes beyond the excavation of hidden narratives" to "project new coordinates for thought." A researcher trained in European institutions, whatever the complexity of their heritage, has no experiential access to this history as a lived condition; the asymmetry is constitutive. What I can do is learn from this corpus—from its strategies of narrative reappropriation, from its way of transforming exclusion from technological modernity into speculative resource, from its insistence that futures are always already contested. These learnings can inform my own practice without my claiming to speak from a position I do not occupy.

*Queer theory* raises different questions. This theoretical corpus has elaborated critical tools—on performativity, disidentification, nonlinear temporalities, resistance to norms—that have analytical reach beyond the specific experience from which they emerge. But even here, intersections of race, class, and geography complicate any simple claim. What I retain from this corpus is less an identitarian content than a method: attention to marginal positions as sites of knowledge, distrust of universals that naturalize particular configurations, recognition that theory always emerges from embodied situations. These methodological lessons can be transposed—cautiously—to other configurations of difference.

Other corpora would require other analyses: Indigenous studies and their elaborations on data sovereignty, Latin American decolonial thought, crip theory and its critique of ableist norms inscribed in technologies, feminisms of the Global South. Each presents its own structure of address, its own conditions of access, its own ethical requirements. The point is not to exhaustively map these situations, but to recognize that positional differences matter and must be accounted for rather than elided through appeals to a universal readership.

My liminal position—European by training, Vietnamese by partial heritage, neither fully—does not give me privileged access to these corpora. It perhaps gives me a particular sensitivity to the very question of access: I know from experience that certain transmissions are interrupted, that certain knowledges remain opaque even to those who might legitimately claim them. This consciousness of interruption is what I bring to the encounter with thoughts emerging from other interruptions, other dispossessions, other recompositions.

### Being Informed by Versus Doing

The distinction between being informed by a corpus and claiming to do the work emerging from it is fundamental, yet it is constantly elided in contemporary research-creation practices. One can be profoundly transformed by Afrofuturist thought—allowing it to reconfigure one's understanding of technology, futurity, speculation as liberatory practice—without claiming to do Afrofuturist work. The influence is acknowledged, the debt is marked, but the work remains one's own, inscribed in one's own situation, bearing the marks of one's own position.

This distinction is not a prudent concession to identity politics; it is a condition of intellectual honesty. This positioning differs structurally from two symmetrical pitfalls. The first is direct appropriation: "I do Afrofuturism," uttered by someone with no lived relation to the history of dispossession from which this movement emerges, who has no accountability to the communities for whom this speculation is a matter of survival rather than aesthetics. The second is exoticization: "I am inspired by African aesthetics," a formulation that reduces a complex intellectual and political project to a visual resource available to enrich one's own production.

Between these two pitfalls exists a narrow but navigable path: that of transformation without appropriation. The formulation might be: "Reading Sylvia Wynter, Kodwo Eshun, and Rasheedah Phillips has fundamentally altered my understanding of the relationship between technology and racialized exclusion. These thinkers taught me that technological modernity constituted itself through the active exclusion of certain subjects from the very category of the human, and that speculation—the imagination of other futures—is not an aesthetic luxury but a practice of counter-memory and survival. My work operates from a European position, marked by the institutions that trained me and the archives with which I work. But it is shaped by this encounter—not as the addition of an 'African supplement' to an otherwise unchanged project, but as a destabilization of the very presuppositions from which that project proceeded."

This destabilization has concrete consequences. Ruha Benjamin's *Race After Technology* (2019) and Simone Browne's *Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness* (2015) are not optional supplements to technology studies, supplementary readings for those interested in "diversity issues." They reveal racial logics inscribed at the heart of supposedly neutral technical systems—from eighteenth-century slave lanterns to contemporary facial recognition algorithms, a single structure of racialized surveillance perpetuates and transforms itself. A researcher working on technology, whatever their position, cannot responsibly proceed as if this critique did not exist, as if technical neutrality were still a tenable hypothesis.

But—and here the distinction becomes crucial—citing this work as an essential interlocutor, as a necessary corrective to one's own blind spots, differs fundamentally from extracting its concepts to decorate one's own project. When I mobilize Browne's analysis of the "racialization of surveillance and the surveillance of race," I do not claim access to the experience she theorizes. I use her work to understand something I could not see from my position—the infrastructures of control traversing the technical systems with which I work. This understanding transforms my work; it does not transform it into Black feminist technoscience.

### Reading With Versus Reading As

The question of reading traverses each textual encounter differently. One can read Afrofuturist texts with attention and care, with the desire to learn and be transformed, without reading as if one were the subject addressed. Every text constructs its implied reader; recognizing that one is not that reader does not disqualify the encounter, but situates it.

Saidiya Hartman's work offers a particularly acute example of this situation. Her books—*Scenes of Subjection*, *Lose Your Mother*, *Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments*—address Black readers in a particular way, with an intimacy and urgency presupposing a specific relation to the history she recounts. When Hartman writes about the impossibility of recovering enslaved lives except through the archives of their destruction, when she invents "critical fabulation" to give voice to those who left no trace, she performs work of mourning and repair that primarily concerns those whose ancestors crossed the Middle Passage. A reader without that genealogical relation to this history can learn enormously from this work—about the limits of the archive, about the violences of representation, about the possibilities and dangers of historical speculation. But they receive it differently. Recognizing this difference is not disqualifying oneself from engagement; it is refusing to flatten the address, to suppose the text speaks to "everyone equally"—the universalist gesture, yet again.

José Esteban Muñoz's *Cruising Utopia: The Then and There of Queer Futurity* (2009) poses analogous but distinct questions. Muñoz theorizes queerness as horizon, as not-yet-here, as refusal of the heteronormative present in the name of a future existing only as trace and promise. His writing is traversed by urgency—Muñoz died in 2013, at 46—and by a specific address to those for whom queerness is not an analytical category but a lived condition, often in precarity and violence. A reader who does not share this condition encounters this text differently than its implied addressee. Muñoz's concepts—utopia as method, disidentification, the aesthetics of queerness—can travel, inform other projects, illuminate other situations. But the ethical response is not to pretend this difference does not exist, to read as if the address were universal. Nor is it to exclude oneself entirely from the encounter, to decide this text "is not for me." It is to mark the difference: to read *with* Muñoz—that is, letting his work transform one's own thinking—rather than reading *as* Muñoz—that is, identifying with the subject he constructs.

This distinction between reading *with* and reading *as* is not a mechanically applicable formula; it demands constant attention to the structure of each encounter. Facing Hartman, I am clearly in a position of learning from outside; facing Hui's elaborations on Chinese cosmotechnics, I am in an intermediate zone—close enough for the question to concern me biographically, distant enough that I cannot claim to speak from within that tradition. Each encounter must be negotiated singularly.

### Amplification Versus Extraction

There is a structural difference between two modes of relation to bodies of work with which one does not share a position: extraction and amplification. Extraction takes—concepts, aesthetics, theoretical frameworks—to enrich one's own work without responsibility to the source, without attention to the conditions of production of what one takes, without reciprocity. Amplification directs attention toward the work itself, creates conditions for it to be encountered on its own terms, contributes to its circulation without claiming to substitute for it.

One can teach Octavia Butler without claiming to write like her. One can include *Kindred* or the *Xenogenesis* trilogy in a syllabus on technology and speculation, showing how Butler thinks the relations between body, technology, and power in a way "mainstream" science fiction never could. In doing so, one amplifies her work—making it accessible to readers who might not otherwise have encountered it, contributing to canon displacement, refusing the automatic reproduction of established authorities. But one does not claim to do what Butler does. One does not appropriate her position to legitimate one's own work.

Similarly, one can exhibit Afrofuturist work in an art institution—if one has that power—without claiming the Afrofuturist position for oneself. One can cite Black feminist technoscience as essential for anyone thinking technology and power—not as an exotic supplement adding "diversity" to an otherwise unchanged bibliography, but as a necessary corrective to the unmarked whiteness of the field, to the implicit universalism that long structured science and technology studies. Citation here is not extraction; it is acknowledgment of debt and redirection of attention.

The question that must guide each citational practice is this: does this citation direct attention toward the cited work and its creators, toward its conditions of production and the communities from which it emerges? Or does it redirect attention toward oneself as cosmopolitan synthesizer, as a figure capable of integrating all differences into one's own encompassing vision? The first option contributes to what Sara Ahmed calls "feminist citational practice"—the patient construction of alternative genealogies, the refusal to automatically reproduce canonical authorities, attention to who is cited and who is ignored, to which voices are amplified and which are erased. The second option reproduces the extractive structure even while citing critical sources—it uses others' work to construct a position of overview, an apparent mastery of the diversity of thought.

This distinction has concrete implications for research-creation practice. When I construct a bibliography, I must ask: am I citing this work because it actually transforms my understanding, or because it signals an openness I want to perform? When I present my work, do I acknowledge my debts in ways that allow the audience to go to the sources, or do I absorb them into my own narration? When I teach, do I create conditions for students to encounter these texts on their own terms, or do I filter them through my own interpretation to the point of rendering them secondary?

These questions have no definitive answers; they must be posed anew on each occasion. But the very act of posing them—of refusing the innocence of the citational gesture, of recognizing that citation is always a political act—already constitutes a form of ethical engagement. Modesty here is not self-effacement; it is the recognition that planetarity can only be built through the multiplication of voices, and that contributing to this multiplication sometimes means being a relay rather than a source, an amplifier rather than a synthesizer.

### From Citation to Collaboration

A concrete alternative to citational extraction is effective collaboration—working *with* rather than *on*. This does not resolve power dynamics but changes their structure. It means being accountable to interlocutors who can contest framings, refuse appropriations, redirect attention. This is not self-evident, nor an obligation, but a possibility.

This differs from "consultation" (extractive gathering of expertise) or "inclusion" (token representation). Genuine co-production means the terms of engagement are negotiated, that one is not the sole author of the frame, that collaboration can fail on the other's terms.

Such collaboration is not always possible or appropriate. But where it is, it offers a mode of relation different from the solitary citational encounter—a mode where opacity is lived rather than merely theorized, where the other's irreducibility is encountered as practical friction rather than abstract principle.

## Coda: The Position of Enunciation

The difficulty of this position is that it must be articulated from within the very framework it seeks to de-universalize. There is no outside, no meta-position from which to survey the plurality of cosmotechnics. This is not a contradiction to resolve but a condition to inhabit. The work proceeds not by claiming to have escaped its situation but by making that situation available for examination—by refusing the transparency that is the privilege of the unmarked universal.

The risk of extraction is never fully eliminated; it can only be held in view, made part of the work's self-understanding, subjected to ongoing critique. This is perhaps the only honest position available: not the achievement of non-extractive practice as a stable state, but the continuous work of examining one's own conditions of possibility and their relation to the broader configurations of power and knowledge within which all practice takes place.

As Rivera Cusicanqui insists, the question is not merely one of a "geopolitics of knowledge" but of a political economy of knowledge—attention to the material and economic strategies behind discourses and narratives, to who benefits from which citations, to how ideas circulate and transform in passing from one context to another. A practice that takes this seriously cannot content itself with theoretical gestures toward plurality; it must attend to the concrete conditions of its own production and reception.
