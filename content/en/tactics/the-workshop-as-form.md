## Introduction: What Is a Workshop?

The question seems trivial. It is not.

The workshop has become, in the teaching of arts, design, and architecture, a form so widespread that it is no longer questioned. We know what it is: an intensive sequence, limited in time, often outside the usual institutional frameworks, oriented toward the collective production of an object or situation. But this functional description says nothing about what makes the workshop specific as a pedagogical form—that is, as a dispositif that produces certain effects of knowledge impossible to obtain otherwise.

This text attempts to answer this question from a concrete situation: two articulated workshops at the École Nationale Supérieure d'Architecture de Versailles in 2024 and 2025, proposing that students "design the ideal school using the architect's classical tools, simplified." This situation is not a pretext for general theoretical speculation. It is the site from which a theory can be elaborated—provided one takes seriously what it engages.

There is a mise en abyme here that should not be missed: asking students to design an "ideal school" within the framework of a workshop is asking them to reflect on the conditions of their own learning at the very moment they are experiencing them. The pedagogical form (the workshop) becomes the laboratory of its own content (the school). The container interrogates itself through what it contains.

The hypothesis guiding this text is the following: the workshop is a form that produces knowledge through the contraction of time and the sharing of gestures. This double operation—temporal compression, gestural community—is what distinguishes it from other pedagogical forms (the lecture, the studio project, the seminar). It is also what makes it particularly pertinent for thinking about what architectural transmission becomes when design tools are traversed by computational logics.

## Generative AI in Architectural Production: A Structural Gap

Since 2022-2023, generative AI—text and image—has occupied a growing place in professional architectural circles. The production of "perspectives" (project visualizations) has shifted: what took days, sometimes weeks, and cost thousands of euros per competition image can now be done in seconds. Agencies—large and small, with different strategies—integrate these tools into their production workflow. This is a fact. It is not a debate.

The problem lies elsewhere. The problem is that what works in a professional production context does not necessarily produce learning. An agency that uses AI to generate perspectives optimizes a commercial process—it saves time, reduces costs, increases its capacity to respond to competitions. It trains no one. It does not need to: its collaborators arrive already trained (or are supposed to be).

The school, however, must train. And this is where the gap becomes structural.

In architecture schools, the shift is even faster than in agencies—precisely because students do not face the same constraints (questions of rights, responsibility, stylistic singularity). As early as 2023, project juries see generated renders appear—sometimes acknowledged, often concealed. Teachers are caught off guard: how to evaluate an image when one does not know whether it represents a thought-out project or a prompted hallucination? How to distinguish design work from the work of formulating a query?

During the two workshops at ENSA-V, we neither prescribed nor prohibited the use of these tools. That was not the point. But their existence—and their now widespread adoption, unchanneled by institutions—merits particular observation. For what is at stake goes beyond the question of authorized or prohibited tools: it is the very nature of the "render" that changes.

The "render"—that final stage where the student gives form to their project for the jury—changes in nature. It is no longer about representing what one has designed; it is about generating what one could have designed. The distinction is decisive: to represent presupposes that one has first thought something that one then translates into image; to generate allows producing the image before having thought the project—and sometimes without ever thinking it.

The difficulty for schools is managing this gap: on one side, a professional reality where AI is one production tool among others, mastery of which is part of expected competencies; on the other, a pedagogical requirement that presupposes the student traverses certain difficulties in order to learn—difficulties that AI allows precisely to bypass.

One cannot prohibit AI in the name of an artisanal purity that no longer exists in the profession. But neither can one let AI short-circuit learning mechanisms in the name of an "adaptation to reality" that confuses producing and learning.

This displacement modifies the two fundamental parameters of teaching: time and gesture.

## The Workshop as a Site of Porosity

The workshop is not a reactionary response—a retreat toward a "pure" craftsmanship that supposedly existed before the digital. This purity never existed; architecture has always been a matter of tools, mediations, technical dispositifs. The workshop is something else: a site and a time of porosity—a space where heterogeneous logics can coexist, rub against each other, contaminate one another.

On one side, the workshop recenters on what tends to fade: the manual gesture, hand drawing, the model one builds and breaks, the introspection of affects, exchanges in co-presence, historical research in documents and testimonies. This is not nostalgia—it is physics. These practices produce embodied knowledge, resistances, frictions. They heat up thought because they force one to traverse difficulties that cannot be bypassed.

On the other side, the workshop welcomes technologies from outside—but bends them to other uses. The digitized archives of Black Mountain College—dispersed among several institutions, accessible online—constitute the working corpus. Milanote allows diagramming ideas, references, connections—making visible the structure of a collective thought in the process of forming. The infrastructures under development—*Dining Hall* to distribute documents on a decentralized network, *Theodore* to dialogue with the corpus—sketch a horizon where access to archives will no longer depend on proprietary platforms.

These tools are not there to accelerate. They are there to open—to open access to dispersed archives, to open the possibility of unforeseen connections, to open the documentation of common work so that it can be taken up, critiqued, transformed. The digital, here, serves an experimental, exploratory, collective, and manual construction. It does not replace the hand; it enriches what the hand can access.

The difference lies in the tool's position within the process. A tool that produces in one's place short-circuits learning. A tool that makes accessible what was inaccessible expands the space of the thinkable. A tool that makes visible what remained implicit relaunches discussion. Pedagogical value is not in the tool itself—it is in what it allows or prevents one from traversing.

The workshop institutes this porosity through its very form: contracted but dense time, shared but equipped space, manual but documented gestures. It does not reject the digital; it subordinates it to a collective construction whose center remains the body, the hand, speech, co-presence—and the heat that arises when one works together under pressure.

## The Workshop as Apparatus of the Exposed Teacher

This text articulates with a broader reflection on the figure of what I call the exposed teacher—the artist-researcher who teaches by showing their work in progress, their gropings, their revisions, their dead ends. This figure opposes point by point that of the master who transmits finished knowledge from a position of overview. The exposed teacher does not say "here is what I know"; they say "here is how I search." They do not model competence; they exhibit the process—with its failures, its bifurcations, its moments of uncertainty.

If the exposed teacher is an ethics (a posture, a commitment in the pedagogical relationship), the workshop is its apparatus (its technical and social machine, the dispositif that makes this posture possible and necessary). One does not go without the other: one can want to be an exposed teacher in a lecture, but the very form of the lecture—the amphitheater, the podium, the physical separation between the one who speaks and those who listen—resists this intention. The workshop, by contrast, forces exposure.

This distinction is decisive. In a lecture, the teacher presents a result—knowledge already constituted, stabilized, formatted for transmission. The process that led to this knowledge is erased; only the finished product remains. The teacher knows, the student does not yet know; the relationship is asymmetrical by construction. In a semester-long project, the teacher corrects the student's result—they judge a finished or nearly finished production. They intervene punctually, during "intermediate reviews" or "crits," but they are not there when the student works. They see successive states of the project, not the work itself.

In the workshop, the teacher is forced to work alongside. Prolonged co-presence, the shared table, common urgency: everything conspires to make visible what, in other pedagogical forms, remains concealed. "Temporal contraction" prevents preparing, rehearsing, smoothing; "gestural community" prevents retreating to an office to reflect alone. The teacher who works at the same table as the students cannot hide their process. Their body hesitates before their eyes. Their errors are visible. Their revisions too.

This exposure is not one pedagogical choice among others—it is structurally inevitable. The teacher can decide to do nothing, to stand back, to observe without intervening; but this very withdrawal will be visible, interpreted, significant. They can decide to direct, to impose a strict framework; but the moments when this framework wavers will also be visible. The workshop is a dispositif of forced exposure: one cannot be there without being seen.

What is exposed then is not only a technical competence (how to draw a plan, how to structure an argument) but a way of being in the face of uncertainty. How does one react when one does not know? How does one traverse a blockage? How does one accept starting over? These questions, which touch on the ethics of intellectual and creative work, cannot be taught through discourse. They are transmitted through presence, through embodied example, through what learning psychologists call modeling—but an involuntary, unscripted modeling that exposes the model in their very vulnerability.

The workshops at ENSA Versailles push this logic further still: they are designed and accompanied by ten teachers. This collegial form, rare in higher education, exposes not an isolated master but an educational body at work—with its disagreements, its complementarities, its internal frictions. Students see not only how one works, but how one works together when one does not know in advance precisely where one is going.

For the ten teachers do not necessarily share the same presuppositions, the same methods, the same criteria of judgment. Some privilege hand drawing, others tolerate or encourage digital tools. Some value programmatic rigor, others spatial intuition. Some intervene a lot, others little. These differences, in a classic semester project, would be invisible: each teacher supervises their group, in their corner. In the workshop, they become public. A student can see two teachers give contradictory advice to the same group. They can observe a negotiation between supervisors about which direction to take. They can witness a disagreement that does not resolve.

This exposure of teaching plurality is pedagogically precious—provided it is assumed. It shows that knowledge is not monolithic, that legitimate experts can diverge, that pedagogical authority does not rest on unanimity but on the capacity to inhabit disagreement productively. It prepares students for professional reality, where clients, engineers, urban planners, elected officials will have contradictory expectations that must be negotiated. It desacralizes the figure of the master without abolishing the asymmetry of the pedagogical relationship: teachers know things that students do not yet know, but this knowledge is not unified, and its transmission passes through the exposure of its internal tensions.

The workshop thus appears as the apparatus of the exposed teacher in the sense that the photographic apparatus is the apparatus of the image: not a simple tool, but a dispositif that configures what can appear, that determines conditions of visibility, that constrains certain operations and makes others impossible. Just as the camera does not "capture" a preexisting reality but actively produces the image through its parameters (framing, exposure, depth of field), the workshop does not "reveal" a preexisting pedagogy but configures it, constrains it, produces it. The exposed teacher does not exist outside the dispositif that makes them visible—and the workshop is this dispositif par excellence.

## Part One: The Workshop Form

### 1. Contracted Time

The workshop is defined first by an operation on time. Where the semester project spreads design over several months, the workshop compresses it into a few days. This compression is not simple acceleration—it qualitatively modifies the experience.

In the long time of the project, the student can defer, hesitate, revise. Time acts as a buffer that absorbs errors and allows corrections. The final render erases traces of the process; only the result counts. This temporal structure has its virtues (it allows maturation, documentary research, deepening) but it also has its effects: it allows avoiding confrontation with what one does not know how to do, bypassing difficulties rather than traversing them.

The workshop eliminates this buffer. There is no time to bypass; one must traverse. The student who does not know how to draw cannot wait to have learned—they must draw now, with what they know. The one who does not know how to build must build anyway. This urgency is not managerial stress aimed at productivity; it is a necessary atmospheric pressure. As in physics, compression heats matter. Here, it heats thought. It forces audacity through lack of time for prudence.

John Dewey, whose influence on Black Mountain College was decisive, called this a "problematic situation": learning arises from encountering an obstacle that cannot be bypassed, that demands a reorganization of available resources. In *Logic: The Theory of Inquiry* (1938), Dewey defines the problematic situation as a state of uncertainty, confusion, or conflict that interrupts the habitual course of action and forces thinking. "Thinking does not appear spontaneously," he writes; it is always a response to something that resists. Without obstacle, no thought—only habit.

This instrumental conception of intelligence—intelligence as a tool for solving real problems, not as a contemplative faculty—would traverse all of Black Mountain College's pedagogy. Josef Albers, who taught there from 1933 to 1949, would draw from it a method: confronting students with materials (paper, metal, fabric) without prior instruction, forcing them to discover through experimentation what the material allows and forbids. Learning does not precede the problem; it emerges from it.

The contracted time of the workshop multiplies these problematic situations. It does not allow the leisure to avoid them. In a semester project, the student who encounters an obstacle can bypass it, postpone it, make it disappear by changing direction. They have time to flee. In the workshop, flight is impossible: the deadline imposes traversing the obstacle or failing publicly. This temporal constraint is not a defect to compensate but a pedagogical condition to exploit. It produces what Dewey called inquiry—investigation as a mode of being in the face of the indeterminate—not as choice but as necessity.

But—and this is a crucial point—temporal contraction is not pedagogical in itself. It can also produce panic, paralysis, sloppy work. What makes the difference is the dispositif in which it is inscribed: the presence of others with whom to share the urgency, the clarity of constraints, the possibility of failing without definitive sanction. Contracted time is a necessary but not sufficient condition.

### 2. The Gestural Community

The workshop's second operation is the sharing of gestures. Where the individual project isolates each student in their production, the workshop creates a space where bodies work together, where gestures are visible to each other, where learning passes through observation and imitation as much as through explicit instruction.

This dimension is often under-theorized. We speak of "group work," of "collaboration," but these terms remain abstract. What is at play in the workshop is more precise: it is the constitution of a community of practice in the sense that Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger gave to this term—a social space where knowledge circulates through legitimate peripheral participation, where the novice learns by observing the expert, where competencies are transmitted through proximity of bodies rather than through explication of rules.

At Black Mountain College, this dimension was central. Period photographs show students and teachers working side by side, sharing the same tables, the same tools. Anni Albers wove with her students; Josef Albers painted before them. The pedagogical hierarchy was not abolished (Albers remained the master, his students remained apprentices) but it was put into play in the common space of making. Knowledge did not descend from master to student through discourse; it circulated laterally through the co-presence of gestures.

This circulation presupposes precise material conditions. It presupposes a shared space where bodies can see each other work. It presupposes tools that do not isolate—tools that one manipulates together, or at least manipulates under the gaze of others. It presupposes time sufficiently dense for co-presence to be effective and not occasional.

### 2bis. The Danger of the Masterclass

But a risk threatens this gestural community: that the workshop becomes a performance of the teacher's virtuosity. The masterclass—that format where an accomplished master demonstrates their technique before an admiring audience—falls back into traditional asymmetry. The teacher shows what they know how to do; the students watch what they do not yet know.

The exposed teacher must use the workshop to show something else: their powerlessness before certain frictions—a material that breaks, a bug they do not understand, an archive that does not answer their question—and the way they traverse it (or not). "Visible labor" is not the demonstration of an accomplished competence; it is the exposure of ongoing research, with its hesitations, its revisions, its failures.

The artist Thomas Hirschhorn formulated this requirement under the concept of "Presence and Production": being physically present on the site, visible, vulnerable, working—not from above but in the midst. In his "Monuments" dedicated to Spinoza (Amsterdam, 1999), Deleuze (Avignon, 2000), Bataille (Kassel, Documenta 11, 2002), or Gramsci (Bronx, New York, 2013), Hirschhorn settles for several weeks in working-class neighborhoods, building with the inhabitants precarious structures from cardboard, adhesive tape, and salvaged wood. He does not delegate the fabrication; he works there, every day, from morning to evening.

The Musée Précaire Albinet (Aubervilliers, 2004) radicalizes this logic: for eight weeks, Hirschhorn creates a temporary museum in the Albinet housing project, exhibiting original works by Duchamp, Mondrian, Malevich, Beuys, Warhol, and Le Corbusier on loan from the Centre Pompidou and FNAC. Residents participate in the construction, guarding, and animation of the site. Hirschhorn is there every day—not as a curator visiting his exhibition, but as a worker among others, sharing meals, conversations, incidents.

Hirschhorn explicitly opposes this presence to the demagogic "participation" where one invites the public to contribute to an already conceived work. In participation, the artist remains the author; the public provides labor or social legitimacy. Presence implies something else: that the artist be there—exposed to the same contingencies as participants, without institutional safety net to protect them from frictions, conflicts, failures. "I don't want to invite people to participate in my work," says Hirschhorn. "I want to work with them, in the same place, at the same time, with the same urgency."

In another register and another framework, the ENSA Versailles workshops explore and push this logic through their collegial form: ten teachers rather than one. Students see not only a body at work, but an educational body in collective negotiation.

### 3. Noise and Silence: The Acoustics of the Studio

The analog studio is noisy—conversations, rustling paper, falling materials, sometimes even sounds of saws and hammers. This noise might seem an obstacle to concentration. It is in reality shared information. It says who is working, at what rhythm, with what tools. It synchronizes bodies without constraining them. One hears someone cutting and it relaunches one's own energy; one perceives a collective slowing and allows oneself a pause. The noise of the studio is a social binder, a basso continuo that weaves together parallel activities without homogenizing them.

Murray Schafer, in *The Soundscape: Our Sonic Environment and the Tuning of the World* (1977), distinguished between "hi-fi" sonic environments (where each sound stands out clearly) and "lo-fi" (where sounds blend into an indistinct magma). The traditional studio belongs to hi-fi: one can identify sources, locate activities, read the space by ear as much as by eye. This acoustic legibility participates in tacit transmission: the student who hears the gesture before seeing it is already beginning to incorporate it.

The digital studio is silent—muffled clicks, headphones over ears, screens that emit nothing. Each in their sonic bubble, each in their flow. This silence might seem conducive to concentration. It is in reality a closure. Digital silence is not the recollection of concentrated work; it is the addition of parallel solitudes. One does not know what the neighbor is doing. One cannot synchronize one's rhythm with the group's. The environment becomes "lo-fi" by default—not because sounds blend, but because there are no longer sounds to blend.

This acoustic mutation has pedagogical consequences rarely thematized. Tacit knowledge—that which is transmitted by immersion, by proximity, by prolonged exposure to others' gestures—presupposes a shared perceptual milieu. When this milieu fragments into sealed cells, tacit transmission is interrupted. One can still teach explicitly (show, explain, correct); one can no longer teach implicitly (let see, let hear, let do alongside).

The workshop must "resonorize" design. Even when it integrates digital tools—and it would be absurd to exclude them—it must reintroduce shared noise. This can take several forms: moments when screens are projected and commented collectively, when silent work becomes public and discussable; structured pauses where one speaks about what one is doing, where the process is verbalized; phases when the digital gives way to material—paper, cardboard, foam—and when sound returns with matter. This is not nostalgia for the studio of yore, but awareness that acoustics is a dimension of pedagogy.

### 4. What the Workshop Is Not

It is useful, to clarify the form, to say what it is not. Negative definition is not an admission of powerlessness; it traces borders that make the concept operative.

**The workshop is not an intensive course.** The course, whether lecture or interactive, transmits explicit knowledge through discourse. The teacher knows something; they formulate it; the student receives this formulation and tries to appropriate it. One can condense a course over a week, make it denser, more immersive—it remains a course. The workshop presupposes that something is done, not only said or shown. The difference is not of degree (more or less intensity) but of nature (discourse vs. action). A course on model-making and a model-making workshop do not produce the same type of knowledge, even if they concern the same object.

**The workshop is not an accelerated project.** The pedagogical project, as it has structured architectural education since the Beaux-Arts, aims at a result: a designed building (even if it remains fictional), an evaluable production, a response to a program. The workshop aims at an experience. Of course, the workshop produces objects—models, drawings, installations, diagrams. But these objects are traces of the process, not its purpose. They attest that work took place; they do not summarize it. A workshop can "fail" in the sense that its productions are mediocre, unfinished, disappointing—and yet "succeed" in the sense that the experience was transformative, that participants traversed something that displaced them. The reverse is equally true: brilliant productions can mask a poor process, seductive objects that taught nothing to those who made them.

**The workshop is not team building.** The confusion is frequent, particularly in professional contexts where the term "workshop" often designates team cohesion exercises. These exercises aim to produce positive affect and social bonds; they instrumentalize making in service of the relationship. The pedagogical workshop aims to produce knowledge—and if social bonds are created, it is as a bonus, as a secondary effect of shared work. The sociality of the workshop is a condition of transmission, not its end. One does not work together to "get to know each other better" or to "strengthen team spirit"; one works together because certain knowledge can only be transmitted collectively, in the friction of approaches and the sharing of gestures.

**The workshop is not an event.** The event-based—vernissage, festival, happening—produces punctual intensity without demanding lasting transformation. One attends, one leaves entertained or stimulated, but one is not required to keep anything from it. The workshop engages a responsibility: that of traversing the allotted time to the end, of producing something, of being accountable (to oneself, to others, to the collective). This dimension of commitment distinguishes the workshop from the festive "parenthesis" where one can enter and exit at will.

### 5. The Workshop as Situation

We can now propose a more precise definition: **the workshop is a pedagogical dispositif that institutes a situation of learning through collective making in contracted time.**

Each term counts. *Dispositif*: not a method (a set of rules to follow) but a material and social arrangement that configures possibilities for action. *Institutes*: the workshop does not "create" the situation ex nihilo; it modifies a preexisting situation by introducing new rules of the game. *Situation*: not a context (a passive décor before which action unfolds) but what configures possibilities for action and thought. *Learning through making*: the knowledge aimed at is not preconstituted and transmitted; it emerges from the activity itself. *Collective*: the pertinent unit is not the individual but the group; the knowledge produced is distributed, negotiated, shared. *Contracted time*: temporal compression is not an external constraint but an internal condition of the form.

The term "situation" is decisive here. It comes from Dewey, for whom all authentic thought responds to a "problematic situation"—a state of uncertainty that forces investigation. But it also comes from Situationism—from Debord, from the Situationist International, from their critique of the separation between art and life. These two traditions, despite their considerable differences (American pragmatism and the European avant-garde), share an intuition: knowledge and action cannot be thought outside the concrete conditions of their exercise. There is no abstract knowledge that would then "apply" to situations; there are situations that produce knowledge—or that produce nothing.

The workshop does not create the situation from scratch—it settles into a preexisting situation (a place with its history, an institution with its rules, participants with their trajectories, material and temporal constraints) and reconfigures it by modifying certain parameters. It compresses time, redistributes space, suspends certain hierarchies, institutes others. This reconfiguration is always partial and precarious. The workshop does not magically suspend institutional hierarchies, social inequalities, differences in cultural capital between participants. It does not create a temporary utopia where all would be equal. But it creates a space-time where these determinations can be worked differently—where the shy student can speak up because urgency demands it, where the prestigious teacher can publicly err because there is no time to prepare, where improbable alliances can form because the task requires it.

It is in this sense that the workshop is a political form—not because it would carry a political message, but because it reconfigures, even provisionally, the conditions of the common.

### 6. The Political Economy of the Workshop: Extraction or Emancipation?

It would be naive to present the workshop format as an intrinsically virtuous form. The workshop is also a contemporary technology of governance—and as such, it can serve opposing ends.

In design, engineering, and professional training, the workshop often serves to capture participants' creative energy in the form of rapid production, without lasting responsibility. Intensity then becomes a mechanism of extraction: time is compressed to obtain more work in fewer hours; "passion" and "engagement" are invoked to justify conditions that would be unacceptable in an ordinary wage framework. The rhetoric of fecund urgency joins that of neoliberal management—the hackathon is its caricature.

The question is therefore not only pedagogical; it is political. But it is not posed in the abstract. It is posed at each workshop, in its concrete conditions of exercise. First there is the question of the destination of productions. The models, drawings, texts, archives constituted during the workshop—where do they go? If they feed an institutional portfolio, communication, valorization from which students gain nothing, intensity has served extraction. If they remain with students, or better, if they nourish a commons accessible to others—future students, researchers, concerned communities—the logic is different. The Versailles workshop, by depositing its productions in the *Dining Hall* blockchain that gathers archives and reflections around Black Mountain College, attempts to institute this second logic: what is produced together belongs to the commons, not to the institution.

Then there is the question of the distribution of costs. The workshop has a price—in time, in fatigue, sometimes in money (materials, travel, meals). This price is not equally distributed. When students assume the bulk of the burden (put bluntly: uncredited overtime, unpaid work, physical exhaustion) while symbolic benefits go to the institution or teachers, the asymmetry is exploitative—even if no one wanted it, even if everyone was "passionate." Good will is not enough; explicit dispositifs of redistribution are needed: ECTS credits commensurate with investment, coverage of expenses, recognized recovery time. This seems self-evident, but unfortunately it is not always the case.

Finally there is the question of what remains after. The workshop that leaves no trace, no follow-up, no recognition, extracts energy that it does not return. It produces an intense experience that dissolves into institutional oblivion. Conversely, one that is inscribed in a continuity—accessible archives, publications, lasting relationships between participants, possibility of resuming the work begun—transforms intensity into a resource. The event becomes a moment in a longer history, not a closed parenthesis.

The "gestural community" itself is not exempt from these tensions. The description of "making together" presupposes a horizontality that few schools actually achieve. Asymmetries of gender, status, cultural capital traverse the studio as they traverse the rest of society. "Companionship without rigid hierarchy" can mask hidden regimes of authority: who speaks the most? Who is listened to? Who does the thankless work (tidying, cleaning, documenting) and who does the visible work (presenting, theorizing, critiquing)?

These questions do not disqualify the workshop as a form. They recall that a pedagogical form has no virtue in itself—it is emancipatory only if its conditions of exercise are. This presupposes explicit attention to infrastructures: staff remuneration, recognition of collective work, ownership of productions, recovery time, possibility of refusing intensity without sanction. The two workshops at ENSA Versailles are inscribed in a precise institutional framework that assumes this protective politics.

## Part Two: From Making to Knowing

### 1. The Enigma of Practical Transmission

How does one learn to do something?

For explicit knowledge (dates, theorems, definitions), the answer is clear: one learns through instruction, memorization, exercise. Someone who knows tells someone who does not know; the latter retains and repeats until mastery. This "transmissive" model presupposes that knowledge can be detached from the one who possesses it, encoded in signs (speech, writing), and reincarnated in another subject.

But practical knowledge resists this model. How does one transmit the draftsperson's gesture, the carpenter's eye, the architect's sense of proportions? This knowledge is not propositional—it cannot be completely stated in the form of rules. It is "tacit" in Michael Polanyi's sense: *we know more than we can tell*.

The artisanal tradition resolved this problem through apprenticeship: the novice worked alongside the master for years, progressively incorporating gestures they could not have learned otherwise. This model presupposed time (a lot of time) and proximity (continuous physical presence). It also presupposed an assumed asymmetry: the master knew, the apprentice did not know, and this difference structured the relationship.

Modern architectural education broke with this model without really replacing it. The Beaux-Arts system maintained the figure of the studio "patron," but transmission occurred more through verbal commentary (the "correction") than through shared making. The master did not draw with the student; they judged their drawing. Practical knowledge was supposed to be acquired through individual trial and error under the jury's critical gaze.

### 2. What Making Does

The workshop reactivates something of apprenticeship, but in compressed time and without the rigid hierarchy of the master-apprentice system.

A hypothesis: what transmits in shared making is not primarily a content (a technique, a method) but a disposition—a way of being in relation to the material, the tool, the problem. This disposition is not taught through instruction; it is shown in the gesture and caught through proximity.

When Anni Albers wove with her students at Black Mountain, she was not only teaching them weaving techniques (warp, weft, weave structures). She was showing them a way of paying attention to the material—its texture, its resistance, its possibilities. This attention is not a technique; it is what makes acquiring techniques possible. It is transmitted through a kind of contagion: by seeing someone pay attention in a certain way, one learns to pay attention in that way.

The philosopher Matthew Crawford, in his analysis of manual work, calls this *joint attention*: two people oriented together toward the same object, each perceiving the other's attention. This structure is pedagogically powerful because it shows not only what to look at but how to look. The student learns to see what counts in a situation by seeing what the teacher looks at.

### 2bis. The Physical Prompt: What AI Cannot Do

During the two workshops in 2024 and 2025, generative artificial intelligence was a shelved tool. Not prohibited, but set aside, in favor of other tools: pencil, cardboard, fabric, conversation, physical and digitized archives. This choice was not a technophobic manifesto; it responded to a pedagogical intuition that must now be formulated.

The point is not to exclude AI from all future workshops. Indeed, the Retcon Black Mountain project attempts to sketch rather the opposite proposition. But the point is above all to understand what it cannot do—and therefore what other dispositifs must take charge of.

The structure of joint attention described above allows formulating this difference. Artificial intelligence responds to semantic prompts—words, instructions formulated in language. The teacher responds—and makes respond—to physical prompts: situations, material constraints, spatial configurations, accidents.

Time running out is a physical prompt. A breaking tool is a physical prompt. Resisting material is a physical prompt. The body's fatigue is a physical prompt. These constraints are not obstacles to learning—they are learning. They force thinking otherwise, bifurcating, inventing solutions that calculation had not foreseen.

The teacher who works at the common table is the guardian of these frictions. They maintain the conditions—time, place, noise, tools—that produce problematic situations. They do not "transmit" knowledge in the sense of pouring it into an empty receptacle; they maintain a protocol that forces collective intelligence to emerge.

Generative AI, by construction, eliminates friction. It responds to demand; it produces without resisting; it optimizes the path to the result. This is its strength in a production context—and its weakness in a learning context. A workshop centered on generative AI risks producing many images and little embodied knowledge (this is moreover an observation made in workshops at other schools where generative AI was proposed as a tool). But a workshop that would integrate AI otherwise—as an interrogable archive, as a critical interlocutor, as a revealer of biases—could on the contrary enrich frictions instead of dissolving them. The question remains open; it calls for other experimentations.

### 2ter. The Body That Remains: Embodied and Situated Knowledge

The anthropologist Tim Ingold, in *Making* (2013), distinguishes two models of making. The hylomorphic model—inherited from Aristotle—presupposes that a form preexists in the creator's mind, then imposes itself on passive matter. This is the model of the engineer, the industrial designer—and of generative AI, which "applies" a prompt to statistical matter.

Ingold opposes to it a model of *correspondence*: the practitioner does not project a form onto matter; they follow materials, enter into dialogue with their properties, their resistances, their surprises. The carpenter follows the grain of the wood; the potter follows the clay's plasticity. Form is not imposed from above; it emerges from the encounter between gesture and material.

This distinction has direct pedagogical implications. If thought occurs in the gesture, then teaching cannot limit itself to transmitting ideas that the student will then apply. The teacher must show the gesture—and above all, show how the gesture responds to the material. Ingold speaks of "education of attention": to learn is to learn to perceive what the material tells us, to adjust our gesture to its responses.

AI has no hands. It has no body that resists, tires, adjusts. It does not "follow" materials; it calculates probabilities. The workshop is *the site of the hand that thinks*—the space where friction between gesture and material produces knowledge that the machine cannot simulate.

The epistemologist and feminist theorist of science Donna Haraway adds a critical dimension: all knowledge is situated, produced from a particular position—a body marked by gender, race, class, history. The exposed teacher articulates these two dimensions: they show their body at work (fatigue, fluctuating attention, the searching gesture) and they assume that what they teach is situated, produced from a specific trajectory that they do not mask.

This double exposure radically distinguishes human teaching from machinic transmission. AI simulates disembodied objectivity; the exposed teacher says where they speak from.

### 3. Tools and Community

The choice of tools is not neutral in this process. Some tools favor joint attention; others require additional effort to maintain it.

The large work table where several people cut, glue, assemble is a dispositif of joint attention. Each sees what the others do; gestures are observable, comparable, imitable. Errors are visible—one can see someone make a mistake and learn from their error without having committed it oneself. Successes too—one can see an elegant solution and appropriate it. The model one builds together makes its own reasons legible: if it holds, one sees why (the column, the glue, the assembly); if it collapses, one sees why (the cardboard too thin, the cut misaligned). Causes are exposed in effects.

This legibility is pedagogical. It allows learning from one's errors because one can understand them. It also allows learning from others' errors, because they are visible and shareable. The manual workshop—the one we practiced in Eden and Versailles—bets on this legibility: hand drawing, cardboard model-making, weaving, wood construction produce objects where one can point to what works and what does not.

### 4. Toward Another Integration of the Digital

But this legibility is not the prerogative of physical material. It is a property of certain dispositifs—and it can be constructed otherwise.

We have often opposed the "friction" of analog material to the "fluidity" of the digital. This opposition is too simple. Friction, in the pedagogical sense, is not a physical property; it is a resistance that forces thought. Wood that splits the wrong way is a friction like cardboard that warps when painted; but the bug one does not understand is also one. The archive that does not answer the question one poses is a friction. The algorithm that produces an aberrant result forces questioning its presuppositions—it is an occasion for learning, provided one can understand why.

What distinguishes frictions is not their nature (material or logical) but their legibility. The friction of wood is immediately perceptible: one sees the material resist, one feels the force necessary to work it. The friction of the algorithm is often opaque: the result is there (or is not) but the reasons are hidden. Faced with a legible friction, learning occurs through progressive adjustment. Faced with an opaque friction, learning requires other work: understanding the system's logic, opening the black box, making explicit what was implicit.

Both types of learning are valid. A complete pedagogy should articulate both. This presupposes not abstractly opposing the analog to the digital, but conceiving digital dispositifs that produce legible frictions.

A piece of software is not a simple program: it is an arrangement—a dispositif that configures relations between users, data, interfaces, and rules. *Dining Hall*, for example, the decentralized archive on blockchain, makes visible the provenance of each document, the chain of contributions, the rules of governance. This digital tool does not dissolve friction; it produces another one, which forces thinking otherwise about property, traceability, trust. Milanote, which we also used to organize collective thought, does not produce in our place; it arranges what we produce—it spatializes relations between elements, it constrains certain operations and facilitates others.

A future workshop could integrate generative AI itself—not as a producer of final images, but as a critical interlocutor. Asking a model to generate variations on a project, then collectively analyzing what it "understood" and what it missed. Using its "hallucinations" as revealers of its training data's biases. Comparing what it produces to what one made by hand, and understanding the difference. AI would then become a distorting mirror—a tool for seeing otherwise what one does, not for doing it in one's place.

This methodology remains to be invented. It would presuppose constructing protocols where AI is put into play collectively, where its productions are discussed, critiqued, deconstructed—not consumed in silence before an individual screen. It would also presuppose accepting that the time for this discussion is incompressible time, which resists the instantaneity of generation.

The manual workshop we practiced was a first step—a foundation of legible frictions on which other experimentations can build. The point was not to flee the digital, but to first build a gestural community capable then of welcoming other tools without dissolving into them.

## Part Three: Black Mountain as Operator

### 1. The Problem of Historical Reference

How can two schools separated by seventy years articulate without the first becoming a model to imitate or a nostalgic image to contemplate?

The question is more general: it concerns the status of history in architectural education. The discipline maintains an ambivalent relationship with its past. On one side, it venerates it ("great masters," "masterpieces," "founding moments"). On the other, it perpetually surpasses it in the name of innovation, contemporaneity, response to "current challenges." History oscillates between mausoleum and storeroom.

Black Mountain College particularly lends itself to fetishization. The experiment was brief (1933-1957), radical (a self-governed community, an experimental pedagogy), and peopled with figures who became mythical (Albers, Cage, Fuller, Asawa, Cunningham). It ended in precarity and oblivion before being rediscovered and magnified. All the ingredients are assembled to make it a lost "golden age"—which is the best way to neutralize it.

### 2. Neither Imitation nor Rupture: Reactivation

Against imitation (doing "like" BMC) and against rupture (ignoring BMC in the name of the present), we propose the concept of *reactivation*. To reactivate is not to reproduce. Weaving at Versailles in 2025 is not weaving at Black Mountain in 1945. The materials differ, the bodies differ, the institutions differ, the stakes differ. What is reactivated is not a technique or a form but a question: *what happens when one makes together, with simple means, in a specific place?*

This question was Black Mountain's; it remains ours. But the answers cannot be the same because conditions have changed. To reactivate is to take up the question in new conditions and see what it produces. The concept of *retcon* (*retroactive continuity*), borrowed from popular culture, illuminates this operation. In serial fictional universes, retcon retroactively modifies the meaning of past events based on the needs of the present. The past event is not denied; it is reinterpreted so as to open new narrative possibilities.

Applied to pedagogy: the 2025 workshop does not reproduce that of 1945; it reinterprets it. In doing so, it also modifies what Black Mountain College can signify for us. BMC is no longer only a bygone historical fact; it becomes an active resource for thinking the present. Past and present transform each other mutually.

### 2bis. The Chronopolitics of Retcon

The collective Black Quantum Futurism (Rasheedah Phillips and Camae Ayewa), based in Philadelphia, proposes the concept of *chronopolitics*: the way time itself is distributed, valued, controlled, and used as a tool of power. Their work—which mixes experimental music, speculative writing, community activism, and theory—starts from an observation: time is not neutral data but a terrain of struggle. Who has time to think? Who is condemned to perpetual urgency? Which pasts are preserved, taught, celebrated—and which are erased? Which futures are rendered imaginable—and which are foreclosed in advance?

Predictive algorithms—those of the police (predictive policing), banks (credit scoring), platforms (recommendation, advertising targeting)—freeze the future by projecting biased historical data toward the future. If you grew up in a neighborhood where police frequently intervene, the algorithm predicts you are more likely to commit an offense; this prediction justifies increased surveillance, which produces more arrests, which confirms the initial prediction. The loop closes. The past—a past itself produced by discriminatory policies—determines the future, which can no longer be different.

Retcon appears as an operation of resistance—what Phillips calls *temporal literacy*: learning to decode the mechanisms by which our time is stolen, predetermined, colonized—and to undo them. Temporal literacy is not only an analytical competence (understanding how algorithms work, and more generally all types of coercion); it is a practice of reappropriation (inventing other relationships to time, other ways of linking past, present, and future).

The workshop, in this perspective, is not an "acceleration." Intensity is not speed; it is density. The confusion is frequent: one believes a five-day workshop is a five-month project "accelerated," compressed, profitabilized. This is a misunderstanding. Acceleration maintains the temporal structure while compressing it; it produces the same thing faster. The workshop produces something else—something that long time would not produce, something that exists only in density. The workshop is a time machine, not a production accelerator. It makes temporal strata coexist that ordinary linearity keeps separate: BMC's past, the studio's present, the imagined school's future—and also each participant's personal past (what they already know, what they have lived), the present of their body (their fatigue, their attention, their rhythm), the future of their training (what they will become, what they will do with this experience).

Against the linear and predictive time of algorithms, the workshop thus activates heterogeneous temporalities that coexist without reducing to each other: machine time (instantaneous, recursive, indifferent to fatigue), body time (slow, cyclical, subject to exhaustion and recovery), ancestral time (long memory, heritage, debt toward those who preceded), project time (maturation, revision, always-deferred completion), and the time of the imagined "after."

These times do not add up; they rub against each other, contradict each other, produce interference. The teacher in a workshop learns to navigate between these times—to synchronize when necessary (everyone at the same rhythm for a collective phase), to desynchronize when fruitful (let some advance while others revise). They are not only a "brake" facing digital acceleration; they are a temporal switchperson.

Retcon does not "visit" the past like a tourist visits a monument—with the respectful distance of one who looks without touching, who is moved without engaging. That would be nostalgia: a relationship to the past that freezes it in its pastness, that contemplates it as bygone, that draws from it at best a melancholy, at worst a conservatism ("things were better before").

Retcon rewrites the past from the present to open futures that this past, as it was understood, had closed. It does not ask "what happened?" but "what can still happen starting from what happened?"

This is precisely what predictive algorithms cannot do: they calculate the probable from what has been; they extrapolate the future from the past without ever modifying the meaning of that past. The retcon methodology attempts to invent the improbable by transforming what the past can still become. It reintroduces contingency where the algorithm sees only necessity. In this sense, the workshop that reactivates BMC is an act of *chronopolitical resistance*: it refuses that the past of education (its instituted forms, its sedimented hierarchies, its integrated failures) mechanically determine its future.

### 3. If One Refuses Imitation

What passes is something more diffuse: the proof that another pedagogy is possible. BMC attests that one can teach otherwise—without rigid program, without separation of disciplines, without frozen hierarchy between masters and students. This attestation is not a model; it is an authorization. It says: "this existed, therefore it can exist."

Authorization is pedagogically decisive—and underestimated. Faced with institutional inertia, faced with "we've always done it this way" that justifies reproducing the same, faced with colleagues' skepticism who have "already tried" and "know it doesn't work," the historical precedent provides legitimacy. It does not prove the experiment will succeed—BMC itself ended up closing, in 1957, after twenty-four years of existence, for lack of money and perhaps energy. But it proves it is not absurd, that it is not the fantasy of an isolated visionary, that it was attempted by serious people in real conditions, with results that undeniably produced something.

Authorization also works for students. Showing them that the teaching they receive is not the only possible form is giving them the means to critique—and perhaps transform—the institutions that train them. Knowledge about BMC is not only cultural content; it is a tool. It says: "you are not condemned to what exists; other possibles have existed; other possibles can come to be."

### 4. Place as Condition

Black Mountain College and Versailles share a trait: they are places. Not abstract spaces, not "sites" in the sense of architectural programming—places with a history, a materiality, accumulated uses.

The Lake Eden site in North Carolina still exists. The campus buildings—including the Studies Building constructed collectively by students and teachers—have survived, transformed, reassigned. The site functions today as a summer camp; the lake is still there, the hills too, and certain structures still carry the memory of the gestures that erected them. But this memory is not evident: it asks to be activated. Working on this site is not visiting a museum of experimental pedagogy—it is finding, beneath layers of successive uses, the traces of a way of making that existed there. The place does not speak for itself; it must be questioned.

Versailles is not neutral. The Petite Écurie, built by Jules Hardouin-Mansart between 1679 and 1682, is a building designed to house horses—six hundred—and pages, those young nobles in training who learned to serve the king. French classical architecture deploys its complete grammar there: axiality, symmetry, hierarchy of spaces, enfilades that allow seeing and being seen. Nothing there is gratuitous. The great horseshoe galleries are not merely functional; they are dispositifs of visual control. One surveys horses as one surveys pages. Light enters through high and regular windows; circulations are calculated so that nothing escapes the gaze.

This building embodies a political program as much as an architectural one. Louis XIV's absolutism expresses itself in stone: order, measure, the subordination of each element to a hierarchized whole. The king's body is at the center; everything radiates from him and converges toward him. French classical architecture is a machine for producing obedience through form. Period treatises—Blondel, Perrault—codify orders, proportions, proprieties. Each building has its place in a taxonomy; each space has its prescribed use; each ornament signifies a rank.

Installing a "Black Mountain-style" workshop there is introducing a performative contradiction. It is hacking the source code of French classical architecture—not by destroying the walls, but by inhabiting them otherwise. It is bringing democratic bustle into the monarchical grid.

Black Mountain College, recall, had settled in modest buildings—first a YMCA conference complex, then a campus built piecemeal on the shores of Lake Eden. Architecture there expressed no hierarchy. Teachers and students ate together, built together, shared the same spaces. The Studies Building, erected collectively under architect A. Lawrence Kocher's direction with everyone's participation, embodied this horizontality: a building made by those who inhabited it, for the uses they invented.

The contrast with Versailles is total—and this is precisely what makes the operation interesting. Installing collective work tables in the Petite Écurie galleries is diverting a surveillance dispositif into a co-presence dispositif. The gaze that was meant to control becomes a gaze that shares. The enfilade that hierarchized becomes circulation that equalizes. The high ceilings that crushed the individual become common space that welcomes noise, movement, the unforeseen.

This is not symbolic vandalism. It is an operation of *architectural retcon*: rereading the building from another present, discovering possibilities in it that its designers had not foreseen. Mansart did not imagine that his stables would one day welcome architecture students making cardboard models and dialoguing with ghosts from North Carolina. But architecture, precisely because it endures, lends itself to these reappropriations. A building is not only what it was meant to be; it is what one makes of it.

The two places do not resemble each other—and this is precisely what makes their resonance productive. Lake Eden was a site chosen for its isolation, its modesty, its distance from established institutions; Versailles is a high place of symbolic, patrimonial, institutional power. BMC built its own buildings with makeshift means; the Versailles school inherits an architecture it did not choose. Making these two situations dialogue is posing the question: *what can an experimental pedagogy do in a place that was not designed for it?*

The workshop links these two places not by making them equivalent but by making them resonate. What the BMC experience allows seeing at Versailles is the possibility of another relationship to place—a relationship where the building is not a décor but a resource, where constraints become occasions, where one inhabits the place by transforming it.

### 5. Space as Pedagogical Dispositif

This text has spoken much about gestures, temporalities, studio sounds. But it has remained relatively abstract about the spatial dimension of the workshop. Yet place is not a neutral container; it arranges forms of learning.

How do spatial dispositifs—tables, circulation, light, acoustics, visibility—configure what can happen there? The large common table favors joint attention; individual boxes fragment it. Open space allows mutual observation; partitions prevent it. The proximity of workstations creates opportunities for encounter; their dispersion rarefies them.

The Versailles School, in the Petite Écurie, imposes its own constraints. The high-ceilinged rooms, the enfilades, the axial distribution create a spatial regime very different from modernist open studios or contemporary open spaces. Working with this place is also working with its spatial grammar—subverting it, diverting it, or assuming it.

The workshop could thus be read not only as a temporal framework but as an *architectural prototype*: a proposal for a space for learning. How to arrange tables to maximize joint attention? Where to place tools so they are shared? How to create zones of retreat without breaking the community? These questions are not secondary; they are constitutive of the pedagogical situation.

In this sense, the workshop is an architectural experimentation in action—not on paper, but in the provisional reconfiguration of an existing place. The students designing "the ideal school" are already, through their presence and their practice, transforming the real school. The mise en abyme is completed: the workshop is the laboratory of its own subject, and the workshop's space is the first project.

## Part Four: The Augmented Archive—Digital Tools and Access to Sources

### 1. A Different Question Than Generative AI

The dominant debate about AI in education focuses on generative tools (Midjourney, ChatGPT, DALL-E) and their effects on image or text production. This debate is legitimate but it is not ours—or at least, it is not central.

In the context of this workshop, the digital question is posed otherwise: how can computational tools serve to access, explore, organize, and reactivate a historical archive? And above all: how can these tools support collective work without replacing it?

#### The Tools Actually Used

During the workshops we used digital tools—but not generative AI. This distinction is important.

Milanote served as a shared workspace: an infinite board where one deposits images, texts, references, connections. Each group could visualize their research in the process of forming—archival documents alongside sketches, citations alongside photographs of models. The tool produces nothing; it makes visible the structure of a collective thought. It allows seeing the links one traces, the groupings one operates, the hierarchies one builds. It is a dynamic diagram—a support for conversation, not a substitute.

The digitized archives of Black Mountain College—accessible via the *Western Regional Archives* website, the *Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center*, and various online collections—constituted the working corpus. Letters, photographs, testimonies, course programs, building plans: thousands of documents that students explored, selected, reinterpreted. Digital access does not replace the physical archive; it multiplies it, makes it available from a distance, allows transversal paths.

#### Infrastructures Under Development

The "Retcon Black Mountain" project also develops more ambitious infrastructures, which were not yet deployed during the first workshops but which sketch a horizon:

*Dining Hall* is a decentralized archive system using blockchain and peer-to-peer protocols (IPFS, OrbitDB). The idea: documents are not stored on a central server controlled by an institution or company, but distributed on a network of peers. Each participant can contribute to the archive, consult it, duplicate it. This infrastructure is not only technical; it is political—it refuses that BMC's collective memory depend on proprietary platforms.

*The Library* is a search engine built from a library of more than five thousand digitized books—works on BMC, on experimental pedagogy, on the history of art and architecture, theoretical texts that nourish the research. Its particularity: only annotations appear in search results. The original text of the books remains invisible; what emerges are the traces of reading—underlinings, marginalia, comments—left by researchers who have traversed these works. The tool thus inverts the usual logic of documentary research: instead of searching in books for what their authors wrote, one searches for what their readers found there. The library becomes a palimpsest of crossed readings, an archive of attentions rather than contents.

Other tools like *Night Watch*, an encrypted communication network allowing textual exchanges (mesh network), or the mini-tools of the *Tech Dpt* coded in Python were available but were not used.

These tools embody a political position on the infrastructure of knowledge: who controls access to archives? How to avoid collective memory depending on proprietary platforms? How to create digital commons that last?

### 2. The Archive as Commons: Toward a Prismatic Archive

The question of the archive is always a question of power. Who preserves? Who gives access? Under what conditions? BMC's archives are dispersed among several institutions (the Western Regional Archives, foundations and universities, private collections). Their access is unequal: some documents are digitized and accessible online, others require physical travel, still others are inaccessible for reasons of rights or conservation. This dispersion favors certain researchers (those who have the means to travel, the institutional affiliations that open doors) and excludes others.

The *Dining Hall* project—still under development—attempts another logic: constituting an archival commons on a decentralized network where no single actor controls access. Each node in the network can host a copy of the archive and contribute to its enrichment. This infrastructure refuses the centralization of dominant platforms and affirms that access to knowledge about BMC—an experience that precisely advocated the commons—should not depend on proprietary logics.

Two archiving regimes can be opposed. The *liquid archive* is that of Big Data: a mass where everything mixes, where provenances fade, where singularities dissolve into statistical averages—a commons without governance. The *prismatic archive*, by contrast, does not dissolve light; it diffracts it. It maintains gaps, preserves grain against smoothing, articulates technical gestures to an explicit political project. Three characteristics distinguish it: explicit governance (discussed and modifiable rules, as Elinor Ostrom showed for durable commons), traceability of provenances (knowing where each document comes from, condition of critique), and maintenance of singularities (preserving what resists the average—minor works, failed attempts, marginal voices). *Dining Hall* attempts to be a prismatic archive: blockchain guarantees traceability, the peer-to-peer protocol distributes governance, the delimited corpus preserves singularities.

### 3. The Recursive Archive: When Outputs Become Inputs

The term *retcon* comes from the comics and television series industry. It is a contraction of *retroactive continuity*—the practice of retroactively modifying the history of a character or universe so that new elements integrate into it. A character one believed dead reappears; it is revealed they had in fact survived, and this revelation changes the meaning of everything that has happened since. Retcon does not deny the past; it rewrites it from the present.

The "Retcon Black Mountain" project—of which this workshop is a component—takes this concept seriously as a research-creation method. The point is not to study BMC as a closed historical object, nor to "revive" it through nostalgic reconstitution. The point is to rewrite what BMC can signify by questioning it from a present that poses questions that the actors of the time could not formulate.

What does the BMC experience tell us about teaching in the AI era? The college's founders were obviously not asking themselves this question. But we can pose it to them retroactively—and their practice can answer it, otherwise than they would have done themselves. This is not a distortion of history; it is an activation. The past speaks only if one poses questions to it from the present. And the questions we pose transform what the past can say.

This operation has an important archival consequence. Reactivating BMC is adding to the archive layers of interpretation that will modify what BMC can signify for future users. The models produced at Versailles, the drawings, the texts, the recordings of discussions—all this constitutes new strata that will superimpose on the original documents. A researcher in 2040 who interrogates BMC's archives will find not only Josef Albers' letters and photographs of the Studies Building, but also the traces of what French students made of these documents in 2025.

This recursivity is not a contamination of the archive by foreign elements. It is the very condition of the archive's life. An archive that would never be interrogated, never reinterpreted, never augmented, would be a dead archive—an inert deposit that no one consults. The living archive is one that accumulates layers of reading, that bears the traces of those who have traversed it. The marginalia of medieval readers are part of the manuscripts they annotated. A collection's successive catalogs say something about the collection itself. The history of reception is part of the history of the work.

The project assumes this recursivity and makes it explicit. The workshop's productions will not be separated from BMC's "original" archives; they will be deposited there, documented, made accessible. The Versailles students of 2025 will modify what the students of 2030 will be able to find when they interrogate BMC. This is a responsibility: what we produce will become a resource—or an obstacle—for others. It is also a liberation: we are not required to "respect" a sacred archive; we are invited to enrich it.

The structure is that of a feedback loop. BMC's archives inform the workshop; the workshop produces interpretations; these interpretations are documented and deposited in the archive; the enriched archive will inform future workshops—which will produce new interpretations, and so on. Each iteration modifies the system. The archive is not a stock one consults; it is a flow one feeds.

The archive is not a deposit; it is a process. It does not preserve the past intact; it transforms it by the very act of interrogating it. And this transformation is not a loss of fidelity; it is the condition for the past to remain alive—that is, capable of surprising us, resisting us, teaching us something we did not already know.

## Conclusion: Situation, Capabilities, Gesture

One sentence could summarize the foregoing: **to learn architecture is to learn to create situations where something can happen.**

The workshop is a machine for producing situations. Through the contraction of time, it forces decisions one would have deferred. Through the co-presence of bodies, it makes visible gestures one would have hidden. Through collective work, it makes emerge ideas no individual would have had alone. Through the friction of materials, it forces thinking otherwise than expected.

What is learned in a situation cannot be transmitted through instruction. One can explain how to hold a tool, but not how to feel when the material resists. One can theorize collaboration, but not how to truly listen to what the other is trying to say. This knowledge—what Michael Polanyi called *tacit knowledge*, what Gilbert Ryle distinguished from *knowing that* under the name *knowing how*—is embodied, situated, relational. It is acquired in the situation or not at all.

Critical discourses on the digital in education often invoke "sovereignty"—temporal, creative, subjective. This vocabulary is politically understandable but conceptually problematic. Sovereignty presupposes a unified subject, master of themselves. Yet everything we know about technics—from Simondon to Stiegler—shows that the subject is always-already constituted by the dispositifs that traverse it. To claim sovereignty is to postulate what is precisely in question.

Simondon showed that technical alienation comes not from the machine but from its misunderstanding. The response is not sovereign withdrawal but technical culture—a familiarity with the schemas that traverse machines. Stiegler, extending Simondon, insisted on the pharmacological dimension: every *pharmakon* is poison and remedy, and it is use—informed, critical, collective—that decides what it becomes. Rather than sovereignty, let us speak of *capabilities*. The term comes from Sen and Nussbaum: not the resources possessed but what persons can effectively do and be. Capability is not an attribute of the isolated subject; it is a possibility of action that certain conditions open or close. And above all: it emerges in encounter, collective work, listening.

The question becomes: what capabilities can the workshop develop that the solitary use of screens tends to atrophy?

---

Four orders of capabilities—not as program but as horizon.

*Critical capabilities*: interrogating tools, understanding their presuppositions, perceiving their effects. The student who uses an image generator without understanding what it was trained on is not a competent user—they are a blind consumer.

*Technical capabilities*: mastery of gestures and know-how. Richard Sennett has shown that the intelligence of the hand is not an archaic residue; it is an irreducible form of thought that proceeds through trial and dialogue with the material. The workshop is the site where these capabilities are acquired in their embodied form.

*Attentional capabilities*: perceiving what counts, maintaining sustained attention. These capabilities are perhaps the most threatened by the attention economy that Yves Citton analyzes. The workshop can institute a different attentional regime—slower, more shared. Listening to someone working beside you, perceiving the rhythm of a group: these forms of joint attention are not learned before a screen.

*Capabilities of bifurcation*: changing direction, breaking with an ongoing logic. The algorithm does not bifurcate—it optimizes. The student in a workshop can decide to start over because a conversation displaced them, because the material resisted otherwise than expected. The workshop's urgency, paradoxically, makes this bifurcation possible: when one has only five days, one can allow oneself to change everything on the third.

---

Against the temptation to dissolve pedagogical asymmetry in an illusory horizontality, one must maintain that transmission presupposes a difference. Rancière, in *The Ignorant Schoolmaster*, showed that this difference does not imply explication—but he does not dissolve the pedagogical relationship; he reconfigures it. The master remains necessary as a will that supports another will.

The workshop is the site where this asymmetry can be put into play rather than frozen. The teacher works there with the student; authority legitimates itself through demonstration rather than status.

The exposed teacher is a *maintainer*—in the sense that theorists of care have given to this term, in the sense also that free software developers give it when they speak of code maintenance. To maintain is to hold together what would tend to fall apart; it is to repair what breaks; it is to ensure that the conditions of encounter are assembled. This figure is inspired by the concept of *lumbung* developed by the Indonesian collective ruangrupa—curators of Documenta 15 in 2022. *Lumbung* designates, in Javanese rural communities, the communal rice barn where resources are pooled and redistributed according to collectively negotiated rules. Each contributes according to their means, takes according to their needs; no one possesses alone. Authority in the lumbung is not that of the owner who decides resource allocation but that of the guardian who ensures that sharing rules are respected, that the barn remains practicable, that conflicts find resolution.

Transposed to the workshop: the teacher does not "build" the ideal school in place of the students. They maintain the protocol—time, place, constraints, necessary noise—that allows collective intelligence to emerge. They are the guardian of friction against the fluidity of the digital interface. Their authority comes not from what they possess—knowledge, grading power—but from what they do under others' gaze, and from what they accept not mastering. For this model to hold, maintenance must become shared competence. The goal is to train other maintainers, to distribute the burden of care.

This text is not a program. The workshops at ENSA Versailles have been something else—an ensemble of gestures, encounters, productions that no text could have anticipated. John Cage, who taught at Black Mountain College and created there in 1952 the first happening, understood this: the score is not the music; the protocol is not the experience. What counts is what happens *between* instructions, *between* participants. What counts is not that the workshop realize a preconceived model. It is that it create a situation where something can be learned—something one did not know before and that one will only grasp after the fact.

Several construction sites remain open. *Documentation*: how to keep trace without transforming the experience into spectacle? *Curricular articulation*: how to prevent the workshop from remaining a parenthesis without effect on ordinary practices? *Tools*: each infrastructure—digital or analog—should be interrogated according to Illich's criterion: is it convivial (does it increase autonomy) or industrial (does it create dependency)? *Transmission of the format*: how to share the experience not as model but as adaptable protocol?

This text assumes contradictions. It advocates exposure but writes from a position of authority, that of an artist who is also a researcher. It values the collective but results from solitary work. These contradictions are not faults; they are tensions to inhabit. Adorno wrote that there is no right life in the wrong life. Perhaps there is no perfectly emancipatory pedagogy in an institution that is not. But there are gestures, forms, situations that open breaches.

To finally conclude, I want to recall that Black Mountain College does not tell us how to do it. It tells us that it is possible—that people tried to create situations of learning through collective making. They failed; the college closed in 1957. But their failure is instructive. It shows that pedagogical experimentation is fragile, that it can exhaust itself. It also shows that it can leave traces that continue to act long after.

Josef Albers repeated: "I want to open eyes." Not give answers; open eyes. The Versailles workshops, if they succeed, will have opened some eyes. If they fail, they will have posed the conditions of opening—and someone else, later, will take up the gesture.

Retcon is not a restoration; it is a relaunch.
