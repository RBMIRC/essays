Author's term: a diagram that transmits stabilized knowledge to a recipient. This is the diagram of the textbook, the published article, the professional presentation. For this regime, Edward Tufte's criteria apply: clarity, economy, informational density. The communication diagram presupposes that the author knows what they want to show and seeks the most efficient means of showing it. Distinct from the *investigation diagram*, which participates in discovery rather than transmission. (*Nodal Thinking*)
