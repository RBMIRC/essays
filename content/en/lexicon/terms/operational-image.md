Harun Farocki and Trevor Paglen's concept: images made by machines for machines, which no longer need the human eye to function. Drone images guiding missiles, facial recognition systems identifying targets, satellite imagery feeding algorithms—a visual regime where the human becomes an accidental spectator of a dialogue between apparatuses. The image is no longer for seeing but for operating; its viewer is not a subject but a system. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
