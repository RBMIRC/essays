Alfred North Whitehead's concept from *Process and Reality*: the most general scheme of real potentiality—the way each fragment of reality extends toward other fragments, touches them, affects them. Not space and time as preexisting frameworks into which events are inserted, but the relation of extension that produces what we call space and time. A stretching, tension, effort of connection between events. The extensive continuum is not empty but full—dense with potential relations awaiting actualization. (*What is a Continuum?*)
