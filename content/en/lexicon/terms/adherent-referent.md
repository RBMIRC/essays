Roland Barthes's concept designating photography's unique ontological structure: the photograph is "literally an emanation of the referent." The photons that touched the photographed subject touched the film, creating a physical chain—"a sort of umbilical cord links the body of the photographed thing to my gaze: light, though impalpable, is here a carnal medium, a skin I share with anyone who has been photographed" (p. 81). This grounds photography's testimonial power, its *ça-a-été* ("that-has-been"). The AI-generated image breaks this chain—it is an emanation of the *dataset*, not the referent. (*L'Archive Liquide*, *The Image Continuum*)
