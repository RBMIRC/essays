Paulo Freire's term (*conscientização*): the passage from a naive consciousness—which undergoes the world as natural given—to a critical consciousness that perceives structures of oppression and recognizes its capacity to act upon them. Applied to AI: passing from naive usage (treating the tool as transparent means) to consciousness of the conditions of image production (training data, labor, infrastructure, ideology). Conscientization is not merely intellectual but transformative—it changes one's relation to the world. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
