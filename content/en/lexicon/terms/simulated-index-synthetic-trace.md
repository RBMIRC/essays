Author's term: an image that has the appearance of a trace without the structure of a trace. It has all the marks of indexicality (the photographic qualia: depth of field, lens flare, motion blur) without the indexical structure (causation by a referent). Testifies to nothing while seeming to testify to something. Captures the paradox of generated images: they look like evidence but are fabrications; they present the form of memory without its content; they simulate singular existence without referring to any singular.
