Rasheedah Phillips's term (Black Quantum Futurism): the way time itself is distributed, valued, controlled, and used as a tool of power. Certain populations are denied futurity—their time is stolen, their capacity to project forward is constrained by precarity and surveillance. Predictive algorithms freeze the future by projecting biased historical data forward, reproducing past inequities as future destiny. *Retcon* appears as an operation of chronopolitical resistance—reclaiming the capacity to rewrite the relation between past and future. (*The Workshop as Form*)
