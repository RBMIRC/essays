The politics of time as instrument of power; term dating from 1970 (Social Forces), developed through Maier and Clark's historiography, and reappropriated by Rasheedah Phillips/Black Quantum Futurism (2016) to theorize "temporal ghettos" of racial capitalism and Afrofuturist counter-temporalities. The way time itself is distributed, valued, controlled, and used as a tool of power. Certain populations are denied futurity—their time is stolen, their capacity to project forward is constrained by precarity and surveillance. Predictive algorithms freeze the future by projecting biased historical data forward, reproducing past inequities as future destiny. *Retcon* appears as an operation of chronopolitical resistance—reclaiming the capacity to rewrite the relation between past and future.
