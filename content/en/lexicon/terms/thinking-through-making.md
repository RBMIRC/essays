What design theorists (Donald Schön, Bryan Lawson, Nigel Cross) call the process where the sketch is not the expression of an already-formed intention but the site of a "conversation with the situation" (Schön) where unexpected properties emerge. The maker does not know what they will make until they make it; the making reveals possibilities that conception could not anticipate. The diagram operates as performance, not just product—the act of tracing is itself thinking, not merely recording thought. (*Nodal Thinking*)
