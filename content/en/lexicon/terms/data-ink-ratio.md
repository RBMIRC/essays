Edward Tufte's measure of visual efficiency: the proportion of ink (or pixels) actually devoted to representing data rather than decoration or structure. A criterion pertinent for communication diagrams where clarity is paramount, but inadequate for investigation diagrams where apparent inefficiency may serve cognitive purposes—where disorder maintains possibilities that premature optimization would close. (*Nodal Thinking*)
