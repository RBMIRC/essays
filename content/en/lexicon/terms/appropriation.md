The unauthorized taking of concepts, aesthetics, or theoretical frameworks from marginalized positions without responsibility to the source, without attention to conditions of production, without reciprocity. Distinguished from legitimate engagement through *citational practice*. The critique applies not only to individual acts but to institutional structures that systematically extract value from marginalized knowledge producers while denying them recognition and resources. (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
