Yuk Hui's concept: the unification of cosmic order and moral order through technical activities. Every culture develops its own cosmotechnics—its own way of relating technical practice to cosmological understanding and ethical orientation. Western technology presents itself as culturally neutral, as pure instrumental reason, but this neutrality is itself a cosmotechnical position: the claim that technique can be separated from cosmos and morality. Recognizing the plurality of cosmotechnics is the precondition for genuine technodiversity. (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
