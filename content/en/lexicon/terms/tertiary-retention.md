Bernard Stiegler's term (building on Husserl): the externalization of memory in technical objects—from writing to printing, photography to cinema, computing to networks. Husserl distinguished primary retention (the just-past held in present consciousness) and secondary retention (memory recalled from the past). Stiegler adds tertiary retention: memory externalized in technical supports that persist beyond individual consciousness. Tertiary retentions constitute the technical milieu in which consciousness forms and transforms. All human culture rests on these mnesic prostheses. (*The Recursive Archive*, *Index*)
