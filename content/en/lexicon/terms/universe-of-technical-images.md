Vilém Flusser's concept: a condition in which images no longer point toward a world outside themselves but constitute an autonomous realm. Technical images (photographs, films, videos, computer graphics) do not represent a pre-existing reality; they generate a reality of their own. Latent space is this universe in mathematical form—a space of pure potentiality, a reservoir of images never photographed, a formalized imagination. (*The Image Continuum*)
