The most sophisticated attempt to create a seed commons using licensing logic adapted from software. The OSSI Pledge functions analogously to copyleft: it applies not just to the seed but to any derivative development, creating an expanding pool of genetic resources that cannot be enclosed by patents. Seeds self-replicate—the genetic information encodes the means of reproduction, satisfying the *constitutive condition* for maximum efficacy. The model demonstrates that commons-based approaches can work in domains beyond software. (*Ethics of the Statistical Commons*)
