Lynn Margulis's biological theory: complex eukaryotic cells are not products of gradual complexification but of fusion—organisms that were once independent (bacteria) incorporated one another to form new entities. Life inside another life, not as parasitism but as constitutive cooperation. Mitochondria were once free-living bacteria; now they are essential components of our cells. Applied to digital culture: evolution proceeds not by inheritance but by infection, not by reproduction but by contamination. The sum of symbiotic combination is "more than two, more than 0 and 1." (*What is a Continuum?*)
