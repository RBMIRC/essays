Author's term: a mode of citational engagement that directs attention toward the original work and its creators rather than absorbing their concepts into one's own project. Amplification creates conditions for a work to be encountered on its own terms, contributing to its circulation without claiming to substitute for it. Where extraction takes and transforms for one's own purposes, amplification points outward, inviting the reader to seek the source. The ethical distinction is not about quantity of citation but about the direction of attention. (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
