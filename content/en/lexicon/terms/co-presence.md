The simultaneous physical presence of bodies working together in shared space and time. Co-presence creates conditions where gestures are visible to each other, where learning passes through observation and imitation, where tacit knowledge can be transmitted. Distinguished from mere simultaneity (being online at the same time)—co-presence requires shared perceptual milieu, the possibility of looking up and seeing what others are doing, the background awareness of bodies in space.
