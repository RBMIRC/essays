Author's term: the unscripted transmission of dispositions through presence. The teacher who works at the same table cannot hide their process—their hesitations, errors, revisions are visible to students working alongside them. What is transmitted is not only technique but a way of being in the face of uncertainty: how to respond when something doesn't work, how to maintain attention through difficulty, how to accept not-knowing as a condition of making. (*The Workshop as Form*)
