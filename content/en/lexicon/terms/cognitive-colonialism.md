Author's term: the extraction of the faculty of judgment from precarious workers to "train" the model. Perception itself is extracted to create latent space—a form of colonialism bearing not only on bodies or raw materials but on cognitive capacities themselves. The ghost workers who label images, filter content, and correct outputs provide the human judgment that makes AI systems function, while their labor remains invisible and their judgment is absorbed into statistical weights. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
