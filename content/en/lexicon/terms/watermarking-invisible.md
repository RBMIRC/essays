Technical enclosure mechanism embedding traceable signatures into statistical noise of images, text, or chemical sequences. Unlike metadata (which can be stripped from files), watermarks survive transformation: the signature persists through resizing, cropping, format conversion. "Weight fingerprinting" allows auditors to run reverse inference checks, enabling corporations to claim ownership of model outputs—a technical infrastructure for extending property relations into the commons.
