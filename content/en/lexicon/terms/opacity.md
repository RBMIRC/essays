Édouard Glissant's concept: the right to remain not fully comprehensible to another's understanding. Against the Western demand for transparency—the imperative to render oneself legible, to explain, to be understood—opacity protects the other's irreducibility. One can work with concepts from the opaque without claiming to have accessed it; one can be affected by what one does not fully grasp. Opacity is not failure of communication but condition of genuine relation: the other remains other. (*De-Universalizing Technics*)



Key citation: "Agree not merely to the right to difference but, carrying this further, agree also to the right to opacity that is not enclosure within an impenetrable autarchy" (p. 190).
