Author's term (drawing on calculus and Whitehead): the infinitesimal—quantities approaching zero while remaining something rather than nothing. "Retains the character of what is disappearing—a virtual residue." This virtual residue constitutes a mode of persistence that is neither presence nor absence: the trace of what is disappearing, the horizon of what is approaching. The continuum is defined by this persistence in the process of disappearing—not fixed points but rates of change. (*What is a Continuum?*)
