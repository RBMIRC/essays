Author's critical term: "post-truth" is a trap because it suggests there was once an age of truth. Truth has always been constructed, contested, negotiated—never simply given or transparently available. What changes is that classical procedures for establishing truth (expertise, institutional authority, consensus formation) lose efficacy—not because they were false but because they presupposed a scarcity (of documents, of speech, of publication) that no longer exists. Everyone can publish; every claim meets counter-claims; the flood of information drowns rather than illuminates. (*Index*)
