Author's term for the ontological spectrum from indexical photography (Barthes's ça-a-été) to statistical generation (Steyerl's Mean Images); maps the transition rather than opposing the two poles. The trajectory from photograph to generated image understood not as rupture but as continuum of successive revaluations—each transformation changing what the image is by changing what it does. The photograph becomes document, archival item, training instance, statistical contribution, synthetic output. Each stage involves ontological mutation yet remains continuous with what precedes it. The continuum is not smooth but articulated—marked by transformations that retrospectively reorganize what came before. (*The Image Continuum*)
