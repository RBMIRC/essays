Gilbert Simondon's diagnosis: we use machines without understanding their genesis or functioning. This misunderstanding produces alienation: the machine is perceived as useful slave (mere instrument for human purposes) or threat (autonomous power opposed to human interests)—never as a reality having its own mode of existence. Technical culture overcomes this minority: not by mastering machines but by understanding them, not by dominating technology but by relating to it. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
