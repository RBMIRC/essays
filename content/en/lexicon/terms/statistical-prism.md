Author's term: how AI sees history—through the lens of correlation and pattern recognition, not through causality, intentionality, or singular context. The model finds patterns but cannot explain them; it detects regularities but cannot interpret them. Produces hallucination as method: filling gaps by applying statistical continuity, generating plausible completions that may have no basis in actuality. (*Index*)
