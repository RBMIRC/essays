A pedagogical format where an accomplished master demonstrates their technique before an admiring audience. Falls back into traditional asymmetry: the teacher shows what they know; students watch what they don't. The exposed teacher must show something else: not mastery but process—powerlessness before certain frictions and the way they traverse it (or not). Vulnerability rather than virtuosity.
