Author's term: ecological ethics requiring active contribution of rare, local, and strange data to counteract the entropic convergence of AI systems toward the mean. Not merely "do not take too much" (a logic of conservation) but "actively feed" (a logic of cultivation). If models tend toward average, ethical practice requires injecting what the average excludes: minority perspectives, local knowledge, aberrant cases, edge conditions. The tails of distribution become zones of ethical responsibility. (*Ethics of the Statistical Commons*)
