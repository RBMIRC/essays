Author's term: applied to archives, *retcon* ceases to be mere narrative procedure to become a mode of engagement with the past that is simultaneously theoretical and practical, critical and productive. It refuses both nostalgia (claiming to restore lost solidity, to return to an origin) and cynicism (renouncing responsibility, accepting that nothing can be done). Work from within liquidity—accept that the archive is liquid and learn to swim. (*Index*)
