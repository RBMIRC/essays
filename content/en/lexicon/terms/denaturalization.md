Making visible what has become invisible through familiarity—revealing the contingent, constructed character of arrangements that present themselves as necessary or natural. The reflexive turn involves naming the apparatus (making explicit what usually remains implicit), historicizing the universal (showing that what claims universal validity has a particular history), acknowledging limits (recognizing that every perspective is partial). Denaturalization is the precondition for transformation: what cannot be seen as made cannot be unmade. (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
