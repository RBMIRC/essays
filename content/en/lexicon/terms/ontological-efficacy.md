Author's term: the criterion of truth in the generative regime. No longer defined by correspondence to a stored record (did this really happen?) but by the capacity of a synthetic artifact to acquire causal traction in the world—to be believed, shared, acted upon, integrated into networks of reference. The generated image is "true" if it becomes effective, if it durably integrates itself into the fabric of reality regardless of its origin. A pragmatics of plausibility replacing a metaphysics of reference. (*The Recursive Archive*)
