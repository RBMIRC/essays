Author's term for archive that queries itself; where traditional archives await external interrogation, recursive archives generate questions about their own conditions and gaps. An archive that accumulates layers of interpretation that modify what its documents can signify for future users. The traces of what students made of documents in 2025 become strata superimposed on original documents—their annotations, their projects, their questions become part of what future researchers encounter. The living archive bears the traces of those who have traversed it; it thickens rather than remains static. (*The Workshop as Form*)
