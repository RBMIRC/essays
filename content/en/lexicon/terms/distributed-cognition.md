Edwin Hutchins's concept: cognition as extending beyond the individual brain to include tools, environments, and social interactions. Thinking happens in the system, not just in the head—the navigator using charts and instruments, the pilots in a cockpit coordinating, the scientists collaborating around a shared representation. The workshop is a site of distributed cognition: the diagram on the wall, the model on the table, the conversation between participants are all part of the thinking process. (*The Workshop as Form*)
