Author's term: an archive that does not merely document what was but opens onto what might have been and what might yet become. Treats documents not as testimonies of a closed past (what actually happened) but as virtualities awaiting actualization (what might be made to happen). Reverses presentism by reopening the temporal horizon—the past contains unrealized possibilities available for contemporary reactivation. (*The Recursive Archive*)
