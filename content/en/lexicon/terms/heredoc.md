Unix notation allowing multiline text to be encapsulated in executable code—a way of embedding documents within programs. Transformed in the corpus into a radical political concept: the political heredoc operates a triple mutation of code into an instrument of democratic contagion. It is transparent cartography of intention (the code shows what it does), vector of creative contamination (it spreads through copying and modification), and rhizomatic node in distributed knowledge architecture (each instance connects to others). Each generated function carries within it the traces of its collective genealogy. (*Heredoc Manifesto*)
