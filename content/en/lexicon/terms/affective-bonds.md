Michelle Caswell's concept: the relationships of care, accountability, and belonging that community archives create through their practice. In a feminist ethics approach, archivists are seen as "caregivers, bound to records creators, subjects, users, and communities through a web of mutual affective responsibility." These bonds counter *symbolic annihilation*—the absence or misrepresentation of marginalized communities in dominant archives—producing instead "representational belonging." Mainstream institutions should learn from these practices. (*Index*)
