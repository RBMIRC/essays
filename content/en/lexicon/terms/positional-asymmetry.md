Author's term: the structural difference in citational situations depending on whose thought is engaged. Different bodies of thought present different relational structures: Afrofuturism emerges from a specific history of dispossession that non-Black scholars do not share; queer theory elaborates tools with analytical reach potentially beyond specific experience. Each must be negotiated singularly—there is no general rule for engagement across difference, only the requirement of care, attention, and responsibility. (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
