Author's term: the progressive dispossession of the subject who looks, frames, decides, testifies. Tracing a trajectory through key theorists: from Benjamin we lose the exploration of the real for an exploration of language; from Barthes, the attestation of the past for the suggestion of the probable; from Sontag, the capture of the subject for the extraction of data; from Flusser, the game against the apparatus for submission to the program. What remains when the human is progressively removed from the circuit of image production? (*L'Archive Liquide*)
