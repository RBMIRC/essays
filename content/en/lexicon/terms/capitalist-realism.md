Mark Fisher's term for the pervasive sense that capitalism is the only viable political and economic system—"it is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism." This ideological closure, where alternatives appear not merely undesirable but literally unthinkable, affects how we relate to utopian archives like BMC. The experimental college becomes either a nostalgic curiosity or an impossible dream rather than a living resource for present transformation. (*The Recursive Archive*, *Index*)
