Author's term: the diagnosis of what is missing in the liquid archive—a political dimension allowing recombination of perspectives rather than their dissolution into average. The archive liquefies when it loses its prismatic dimension—its collective and reconfigurable dimension. The default is social (ghost labor invisibilized), epistemic (minority perspectives erased by regression to mean), and ecological (material costs concealed behind cloud metaphors).
