Subdomain of AI where systems learn from data (patterns) rather than through explicit programming. It is the paradigm that makes the dissolution of attribution possible—knowledge is extracted from examples rather than encoded by identifiable authors. The statistical nature of learning erases the boundaries between individual contributions. (*The Heredoc Manifesto*)
