Concerning the undoing of colonial structures of knowledge and power that persist after formal political decolonization. Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui critiques "decolonial" as "an unbearable fashionable neologism" when academic appropriation depoliticizes radical concepts—when the term becomes a credential rather than a practice. The question is not merely geopolitics of knowledge (who speaks from where) but political economy of knowledge (who benefits from whose labor). (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
