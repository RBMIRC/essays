Hui's concept (2016) supplementing Stiegler's tertiary retention; where Stiegler theorized externalized memory (retention), Hui adds externalized anticipation—technologies that structure futurity, from debt to algorithmic prediction. Where tertiary retention externalizes memory (writing, photography, computing store what we cannot remember), tertiary protention externalizes anticipation (algorithms predict what we will want, recommend what we will do, pre-structure what we will think). In the era of recommendation algorithms and predictive AI, machines no longer merely store data—they anticipate our needs, desires, future queries. The archive becomes a technology of anticipation.
