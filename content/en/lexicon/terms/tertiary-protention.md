Yuk Hui's concept building on Stiegler: where tertiary retention externalizes memory (writing, photography, computing store what we cannot remember), tertiary protention externalizes anticipation (algorithms predict what we will want, recommend what we will do, pre-structure what we will think). In the era of recommendation algorithms and predictive AI, machines no longer merely store data—they anticipate our needs, desires, future queries. The archive becomes a technology of anticipation. (*The Recursive Archive*)
