Ramón Grosfoguel's term: the appropriation of knowledge from marginalized communities by researchers operating within dominant institutional frameworks. Knowledge circulates from South to North, is processed by metropolitan academic machinery (translated, theorized, published in prestigious venues), and returns in forms that marginalize its creators—who become "informants" or "case studies" rather than theorists in their own right. The political economy of knowledge parallels the political economy of raw materials. (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
