José Esteban Muñoz's concept from queer theory: a strategy that works on and against dominant ideology, neither fully identifying with nor wholly rejecting it. Disidentification takes the materials of dominant culture and reworks them—inhabiting stereotypes excessively, appropriating symbols for unexpected purposes, finding resources for survival in hostile representations. A methodological lesson transposable to other configurations of difference: working within systems while working against them. (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
