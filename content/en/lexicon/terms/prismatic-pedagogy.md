Author's term: not merely a method but a toolbox rooted in multiple traditions—Deweyan inquiry (learning through problematic situations), Freirean conscientization (critical awareness of structures), Rancièrean emancipation (equality of intelligences), Simondonian technical culture (understanding how things work), Stieglerian pharmacology (technology as poison and remedy), Yuk Hui's technodiversity (plurality of cosmotechnics), Illichian conviviality (tools that increase autonomy). Each context calls for its own articulations; no single approach suffices. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
