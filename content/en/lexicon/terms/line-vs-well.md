Author's term: two regimes of thought. Line-thinking moves, connects, traverses—essentially kinetic, covering ground, linking points. Well-thinking implies digging: staying at one point but descending into it, accepting progressive obscurity as depth increases, trusting that something will be found below. Reading a difficult text for three hours is digging a well. The diagram cannot represent vertical work—it necessarily flattens it into a simple node among others, erasing the labor of descent. (*Nodal Thinking*)
