Tim Ingold's term for a model of making opposed to the hylomorphic. The practitioner does not project a preexisting form onto passive matter; they follow materials, enter into dialogue with their properties, their resistances, their surprises. Form emerges from the encounter between gesture and material—neither imposed from above nor simply found in the matter. The maker corresponds with materials as one corresponds with a friend: through ongoing exchange that transforms both parties. (*The Workshop as Form*)
