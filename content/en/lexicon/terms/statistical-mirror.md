Author's term: what the generative self-portrait produces. Not an image of oneself but a statistical average of what the model associates with the prompt—what "faces like this" look like according to the training distribution. The generated face is a vectorial approximation, a composite of millions of faces encoded in latent space. Returns not the subject but what the dataset "thinks" of the subject—not identity but statistical type. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
