R. Murray Schafer's distinction from acoustic ecology: hi-fi environments where each sound stands out clearly, can be identified and located; lo-fi environments where sounds blend into an indistinct magma, masking each other. The traditional studio is hi-fi—one can identify sources, locate activities, read space by ear. Ambient sound carries information about what others are doing. The digital studio's silence creates lo-fi by absence: parallel solitudes, sealed cells, no shared acoustic environment. (*The Workshop as Form*)
