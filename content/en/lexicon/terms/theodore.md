Project within the Retcon Black Mountain research: an AI chatbot being developed to dialogue with the Black Mountain College corpus. Part of the research-creation infrastructure, distinct from generative AI tools used for image production. Theodore is designed to make the archive conversational—to allow researchers and students to query the corpus through natural language, receiving responses synthesized from documents.
