Gilbert Ryle's distinction: practical knowledge (knowing how to ride a bicycle, how to judge proportions, how to read a situation) versus propositional knowledge (knowing that Paris is the capital of France, that water boils at 100°C). Know-how cannot be fully converted to know-that; there is always a remainder that resists articulation. The workshop transmits know-how through embodied practice—what Michael Polanyi called tacit knowledge: "we know more than we can tell." (*The Workshop as Form*)
