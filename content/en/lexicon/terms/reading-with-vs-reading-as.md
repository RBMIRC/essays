Author's term: the distinction between reading with attention and care, with the desire to learn and be transformed, and reading as if one were the subject addressed. Every text constructs its implied reader; recognizing that one is not that reader situates the encounter without disqualifying it. One can read Afrofuturist texts with attention and respect without reading as an Afrofuturist—the "with" acknowledges relation while the "as" would claim identity. (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
