Author's term: the image that the archive dreams when it processes itself through adversarial dynamics. Captures the spectral quality of generated images—produced from statistical distributions rather than indexical traces. Not a copy of any original but an actualization of latent possibilities encoded in the training distribution. The phantasm testifies to nothing while seeming to testify to something; it has the form of memory without its substance. (*The Image Continuum*)
