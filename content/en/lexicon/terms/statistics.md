Sciences of data analysis and interpretation (etymology: "sciences of the State"). In the context of AI, the term emphasizes that knowledge emerges through sedimentation and probabilistic recombination rather than through individual authorship. Statistical commons names the collective resource that emerges when individual contributions aggregate into probability distributions. (*The Heredoc Manifesto*)
