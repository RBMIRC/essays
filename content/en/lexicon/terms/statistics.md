Sciences of data analysis and interpretation—etymologically "sciences of the State" (from Latin *status*, the condition of things). The corpus uses "statistical commons" to emphasize that knowledge in AI systems emerges through sedimentation and probabilistic recombination rather than through deliberate aggregation. Statistical thinking differs from logical thinking: it operates on distributions rather than propositions, on likelihood rather than truth, on patterns rather than rules. The statistical revolution in AI (machine learning replacing symbolic AI) is also an ontological revolution: knowledge becomes a matter of correlation rather than causation.
