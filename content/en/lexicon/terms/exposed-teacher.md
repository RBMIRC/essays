Author's term: the artist-researcher who teaches by showing their work in progress—their gropings, revisions, dead ends. Opposes the master who transmits finished knowledge from a position of overview. Does not say "here is what I know" but "here is how I search." Exposure is vulnerability: the teacher who shows their process cannot maintain the illusion of seamless competence. But this vulnerability is pedagogically productive—it authorizes students to struggle, to fail, to revise. (*The Workshop as Form*)
