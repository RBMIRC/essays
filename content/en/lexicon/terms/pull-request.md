In distributed version control: a proposal to integrate modifications from one repository into another. The contributor says: "Here are the improvements I made in my fork—would you like to integrate them into your version?" The pull request makes visible the social negotiations underlying code development: review, discussion, revision, acceptance or rejection. It is the mechanism through which forked projects can reconnect, through which individual modifications become collective resources. (*Heredoc Manifesto*)
