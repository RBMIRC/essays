Margaret Boden's term: what current AI systems excel at—recombining existing elements within a given framework to produce novel arrangements. Distinguished from exploratory creativity (exploring the possibilities of a conceptual space) and transformational creativity (dismantling and reconstructing the framework itself). The question is whether AI can move beyond combination to genuine transformation—and whether such transformation requires capacities (embodiment, mortality, desire) that computational systems lack. (*The Recursive Archive*)
