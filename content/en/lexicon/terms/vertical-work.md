Author's term opposing "horizontal" connection (networking, linking, sharing); deep engagement with singular problems rather than lateral movement across surfaces. Resonates with Stiegler's critique of horizontal proletarianization. The labor of digging into a concept rather than connecting it to others. Reading a difficult text for three hours, returning to the same sentence, testing its resistances, refusing to move on until something yields. The diagram cannot represent this work; it necessarily flattens it into a simple node among others. The node labeled "Hegel" may represent five minutes of Wikipedia or five years of study—the diagram cannot distinguish. (*Nodal Thinking*)
