Andrej Karpathy's term (February 2025): programming through natural language prompts rather than traditional syntax. The programmer mutates from composer to conductor, modulating collective patterns rather than creating *ex nihilo*. "The hottest new programming language is English." Reveals the structural transformation of intellectual property into statistical commons: the code you generate was trained on everyone's code, carries traces of countless contributors, belongs to no one and everyone. (*Heredoc Manifesto*)
