Karpathy's term (February 2025) for AI-assisted programming where developers "forget that the code even exists"; extends his 2023 claim that "the hottest new programming language is English." Marks shift from writing to prompting. The programmer mutates from composer to conductor, modulating collective patterns rather than creating *ex nihilo*. Reveals the structural transformation of intellectual property into statistical commons: the code you generate was trained on everyone's code, carries traces of countless contributors, belongs to no one and everyone. (*Heredoc Manifesto*)
