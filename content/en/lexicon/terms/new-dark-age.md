James Bridle's concept: the growing gap between the complexity of systems we build and our cognitive capacity to understand them. "The sheer volume of information reveals less than we hoped. It heralds a world of ever-increasing incomprehension." We are surrounded by systems we cannot understand, making decisions we cannot trace, for reasons we cannot access. The opacity of deep neural networks introduces not enlightenment but a new form of darkness—more information, less understanding. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
