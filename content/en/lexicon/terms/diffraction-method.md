Karen Barad and Donna Haraway's alternative to reflection as critical method. Where reflection returns the same (the mirror gives back what faces it), diffraction produces difference through interference patterns (waves passing through a grating create new patterns). Diffractive reading passes texts through one another to observe what their encounter generates—not comparison (how are they similar or different?) but interference (what happens when they meet?). A critical practice that seeks to understand "which differences matter, how they matter, and for whom." (*L'Archive Liquide*, *Index*)
