Technical architecture: two neural networks engaged in adversarial game. The generator transforms random noise into images; the discriminator classifies images as real or fake. Through this dynamic, the generator learns to produce increasingly convincing images that bear the statistical fingerprint of photography—depth of field, lens distortion, sensor noise—even though no photographic process was involved. The GAN learns not what reality looks like but what photographs of reality look like. (*The Image Continuum*)
