Pierre Huyghe's phrase for what occurs when one enters a preexisting world—narrative, fiction, myth, archive. Archives are such solidified dreams: imaginary worlds (that of an epoch as it was lived, thought, desired) that have taken material form in documents. To enter the archive is to enter this dream as walker, not spectator—moving through it, affecting it, being affected by it, leaving traces that become part of what future walkers will encounter.
