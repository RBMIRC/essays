Gregory Chaitin's paradigmatic example of incomputability: a real number between zero and one whose digits are perfectly determined (by the halting probability of all possible programs) yet impossible to compute by any algorithm. The Omega number demonstrates that within the seemingly closed world of binary logic exist quantities that are absolutely incomputable—mathematical objects that are real but unreachable. The interval between 0 and 1 is not void but an intensive plenitude harboring irreducible infinity. (*What is a Continuum?*)
