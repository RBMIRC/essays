Mark Fisher's concept: unrealized possibilities that haunt the present—futures that were once anticipated but never arrived, trajectories that were opened but not pursued. The archives of experimental projects like Black Mountain College preserve precisely such lost futures: pedagogical and artistic innovations not absorbed into dominant practice, alternatives that remain available for contemporary reactivation. The speculative archive opens onto what might have been and what might yet become. (*The Recursive Archive*, *Index*)
