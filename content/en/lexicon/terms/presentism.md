François Hartog's concept: the contemporary regime of historicity where the present invades both past and future. The past is valued only for its present relevance (heritage, commemoration, immediate utility); the future is collapsed into present projection (risk management, scenario planning, extrapolation). The speculative archive reverses this closure: instead of the present colonizing past and future, it reopens the temporal horizon by activating latent potentialities of the past for futures that differ from present expectations. (*The Recursive Archive*)
