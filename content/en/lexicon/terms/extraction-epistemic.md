Taking concepts, aesthetics, or theoretical frameworks to enrich one's own work without responsibility to the source, without attention to conditions of production, without reciprocity. The extracted material is processed, transformed, integrated into new productions that bear no trace of their origin. Distinguished from *amplification*, which directs attention toward sources rather than absorbing them. The question is not whether to engage across difference but how—with what care, what acknowledgment, what return. (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
