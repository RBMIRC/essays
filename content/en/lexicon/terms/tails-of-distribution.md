Author's term: the rare, marginal data at the edges of statistical distributions—the outliers, the unusual cases, the minority aesthetics. In model collapse, the model first loses these tails: minority perspectives cease to be generable as the system converges toward mean. The tails become zones of resistance: difficult to access but crucial. Power operates by rendering certain thoughts statistically improbable; the tails are where improbable thoughts still dwell, where alternatives survive. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
