Author's term: the short-circuiting of human capacity to imagine the future when AI systems dominate anticipation. The social media feed traps users in a loop of perpetual now, reinforcing existing biases and preventing emergence of the new. Recommendation systems predict what you will want based on what you have wanted—closing the horizon of possibility to extrapolation from the past. A tyranny of the immediate present where the future is foreclosed by being predicted. (*The Recursive Archive*)
