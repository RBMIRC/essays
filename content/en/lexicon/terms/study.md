Fred Moten and Stefano Harney's concept from *The Undercommons*: fugitive planning and black study as modes of being together that exceed institutional capture. Not the official curriculum, not the credentialed knowledge, but what happens in the break—the undercommons where those who do not fit gather, study, plan. The workshop partakes of study: being "in the hold" together, constituting commons through practice rather than property, learning what the institution does not teach. (*Index*)
