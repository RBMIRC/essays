Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger's concept: the process by which newcomers become part of a community of practice. The novice begins at the periphery, participating in activities that contribute to the community's work while remaining relatively sheltered from its most demanding tasks. Through continued participation, they gradually move toward fuller involvement—not by being taught but by being included. Learning is the byproduct of participation, not its goal. (*The Workshop as Form*)
