Tim Ingold's term: learning to perceive what the material tells us, to adjust our gesture to its responses. Teaching cannot limit itself to transmitting ideas to be applied; it must show how the gesture responds to the material. The novice learns not by being told but by being shown, not by receiving information but by having their attention directed—look here, notice this, feel how it resists. Attention is not a faculty we possess but a skill we cultivate. (*The Workshop as Form*)
