Author's term: collections of optimized queries shared as community resources, creating a meta-layer of collective know-how above proprietary models. Like recipes passed between cooks or techniques shared among craftspeople, heritage prompts encode accumulated wisdom about how to get particular results from particular systems. Moving toward a world where every speaker becomes a programmer and each generated line structurally belongs to the commons. (*Heredoc Manifesto*)
