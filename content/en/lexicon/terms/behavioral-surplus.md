Shoshana Zuboff's term: what surveillance capitalism extracts from human activity beyond what is needed for service provision, converting lived experience into predictive commodities. "Surplus" because these data streams exceed what is required for service improvement—they are harvested for markets in behavioral futures. The archive under this regime becomes not a site of collective memory but a resource for prediction and control. (*The Recursive Archive*)



Key citation: "Surveillance capitalism unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data. Although some of these data are applied to product or service improvement, the rest are declared as a proprietary behavioral surplus" (p. 8).
