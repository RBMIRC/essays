Contraction of *retroactive continuity*. In comics and TV: the practice of retroactively modifying a universe's history so that new elements integrate into it—revealing that a character had a secret sibling, that an event happened differently than previously shown. Applied to pedagogy: rewriting what the past can signify by questioning it from a present that poses questions the original actors could not formulate. A form of temporal arbitrage. The theologian Wolfhart Pannenberg held that history flows fundamentally from the future into the past; Joshua Clover links this to political economy: "credit is a form of time travel." (*The Workshop as Form*, *The Recursive Archive*, *Index*, *Retcon Methodology*)
