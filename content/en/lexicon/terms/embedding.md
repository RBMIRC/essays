A dense vector representation of an element (word, image, code snippet) in latent space—typically hundreds or thousands of floating-point numbers encoding semantic relationships. Similar items have similar embeddings; the distance between vectors corresponds to conceptual distance. It is at this level that what the corpus calls "license ghosts" persist: spectral traces of original works that are now mathematically inextricable from each other. The embedding dissolves discrete identity while preserving relational structure. (*Heredoc Manifesto*, *L'Archive Liquide*)
