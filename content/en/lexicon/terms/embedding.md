Dense vector representation of an element in latent space. It is at this level that "license ghosts" persist—spectral traces of original code, now mathematically inextricable from the collective distribution. The embedding transforms discrete legal entities (licensed code) into continuous mathematical objects where boundaries dissolve. (*The Heredoc Manifesto*)
