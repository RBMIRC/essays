Author's term: the cultural regime that governed photography for a century and a half—the assumption that photographs were traces of what they depicted, that to see a photograph was, in some sense, to see the thing itself. Photography served as evidence in courts, documents in archives, records in science. This dispensation rested on indexicality: the physical causation linking image to referent. The generated image marks the end of this dispensation—it looks like a photograph but has no referent. (*The Image Continuum*)
