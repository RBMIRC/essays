Matthew Crawford's term: two people oriented together toward the same object, each perceiving the other's attention to it. Pedagogically powerful because it shows not only *what* to look at but *how* to look. The student learns to see what counts by seeing what the teacher looks at—attending not only to the object but to the quality and rhythm of the teacher's attention to the object. Joint attention cannot be digitally mediated in the same way; it requires shared perceptual space. (*The Workshop as Form*)
