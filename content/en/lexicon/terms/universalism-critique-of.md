The gesture of "openness" may constitute the subtlest form of extraction: presupposing all knowledge systems are equally accessible to all subjects, that the properly cultivated mind can access and synthesize any tradition. This presupposition ignores how access is shaped by position, how understanding requires relation, how some knowledge is not meant to circulate freely. De-universalization is the precondition for genuine plurality: recognizing that one cannot simply take what one wants from wherever one finds it. (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
