An abstract mathematical space where data is represented in compressed form—"a probabilistic ocean where all solutions ever written float in a state of pure virtuality." The multidimensional space where machine learning models store their "understanding" of data. Similar concepts are grouped together by proximity—all images of chairs are mathematically close to tables, all portraits close to each other. When we prompt AI, we traverse this space, navigating between points in a high-dimensional archive. We do not retrieve a document (fetch a fixed item from a fixed location); we interpolate a path (generate an intermediate point between stored positions). (*L'Archive Liquide*, *The Recursive Archive*, *Heredoc Manifesto*)
