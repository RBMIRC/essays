The multidimensional mathematical space where machine learning models store their "understanding" of data. Similar concepts are grouped together by proximity—all images of chairs are mathematically close to tables, all portraits close to each other. When we prompt AI, we traverse this space, navigating between points in a high-dimensional archive. We do not retrieve a document (fetch a fixed item from a fixed location); we interpolate a path (generate an intermediate point between stored positions).
