Pieter Lemmens's term (following Yuk Hui): the plurality of cosmotechnics against the universalism of Western technology. Not all technical practices carry the same cosmological commitments; different cultures develop different relationships between technique, cosmos, and moral order. A radical cosmotechnical pluralism is possible—but achieving it requires first recognizing that what presents itself as universal is actually particular, that Western technology is *a* cosmotechnics, not the absence of cosmotechnics. (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
