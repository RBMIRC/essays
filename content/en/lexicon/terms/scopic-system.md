Karin Knorr-Cetina's term from her studies of financial markets: visual devices that do not simply represent external reality but organize collective attention, synchronize gazes, make possible distributed cognition across multiple sites. The trading screen is a scopic system: traders around the world look at the same representations, coordinate their actions through shared visual field. Collaborative diagrams function similarly: around them, attention is organized, gazes synchronized, collective thinking enabled. (*Nodal Thinking*)
