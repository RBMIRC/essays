Hans-Jörg Rheinberger's concept from history of science: an arrangement where something unforeseen can occur. The experimental system is not designed to confirm hypotheses but to generate surprises—to produce phenomena that the experimenter did not anticipate. The sketchbook belongs to this economy of emergence, welcoming what does not yet have form. Distinguished from the stabilized, communicable final diagram which presents results rather than enabling discovery. (*Nodal Thinking*)
