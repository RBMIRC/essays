Author's term (provisional): the spontaneous diagrammatic practice observed among students—using arrows to connect images and concepts, forming clusters and rhizomatic constellations. Must be interrogated rather than celebrated, questioned for its presuppositions and blind spots. The knot may be a productive tangle (multiple connections creating density) or a confused mess (connections that obscure rather than reveal). (*Nodal Thinking*)
