Author's term: the practice of inhabiting the recursive loop responsibly. Not escaping it (impossible once systems train on their own outputs) but injecting prism into the liquid: reintroducing at each iteration the elements statistical compression eliminates—materiality of infrastructures, minority perspectives, irreducible contingency of the real. The steward does not control the loop but tends it, ensuring that what the system would eliminate returns to perturb convergence toward mean. (*The Recursive Archive*)
