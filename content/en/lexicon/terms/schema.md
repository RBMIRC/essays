Immanuel Kant's concept: an operator that aids thinking without claiming to exhaust its object—a mediating representation that allows understanding to apply its categories to sensible intuition. The prism functions as such a schema in this corpus: not naturalizing the archive but making its transformation effects perceptible. The danger would be constructing a "physics of the archive" that naturalizes what it claims to deconstruct—treating the schema as description rather than instrument. (*Index*)
