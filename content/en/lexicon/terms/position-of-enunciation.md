Author's term: the situation from which one speaks—not merely geographic location but institutional position, disciplinary training, linguistic resources, bodily situation. Must be articulated from within the very framework it seeks to de-universalize: there is no outside, no meta-position from which to survey plurality neutrally. The critique of European universalism is articulated in European languages, using European theoretical resources, within European institutions. Not a contradiction to resolve but a condition to inhabit—working within what one works against. (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
