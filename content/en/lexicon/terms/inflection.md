Bernard Cache's term: "the true atom of form"—not the discrete coordinate but the curvature of the curve, the rate of change of direction. A point of inflection is where the curve changes from concave to convex, where acceleration shifts sign. Not a location but a transformation, not a position but a passage. The continuum is defined by such inflections: continuous variation rather than discrete steps. (*What is a Continuum?*)
