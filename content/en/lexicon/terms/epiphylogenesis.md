Bernard Stiegler's term for human evolution through tools and archives: we evolve not only biologically (phylogenesis) but through technical objects that externalize memory and transmit it across generations. We inherit a past we have not biologically lived but technically adopt—learning from books we did not write, using tools we did not invent, inhabiting infrastructures we did not build. Tertiary retentions (technical memory) constitute the milieu in which consciousness forms and transforms. (*The Recursive Archive*)
