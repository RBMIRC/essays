Author's term: the temporal regime of the liquid archive. Programmed obsolescence of memory where the social media feed, based on recursive queries that reinforce engagement, traps users in a loop of perpetual present. The feed shows what is likely to provoke reaction now, eliminating both past (what happened before) and future (what might be different). A tyranny of the immediate present where nothing is retained and nothing is anticipated. (*The Recursive Archive*)
