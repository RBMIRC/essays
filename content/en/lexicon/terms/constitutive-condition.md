Author's term: the condition under which the statistical commons operates with full material force—when the information is constitutive of the material instantiation. In domains where this holds, recombination at the informational level produces functional novelty at the material level. Seeds exemplify this: the genetic sequence *is* the organism. Software code exemplifies this: the code *is* the program. Where the constitutive condition holds, the statistical commons has maximal transformative potential. (*Ethics of the Statistical Commons*)
