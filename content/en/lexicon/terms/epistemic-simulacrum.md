Author's term: what the finished diagram can become when it substitutes for the real work of understanding. The diagram provides an illusion of cognitive mastery, transforming the vertigo of incomprehension into a feeling of control. It mimes the external signs of understanding (connection, organization, overview) without understanding having occurred. The production of diagrams can become a defense against the difficulty of thought rather than a support for it. (*Nodal Thinking*)
