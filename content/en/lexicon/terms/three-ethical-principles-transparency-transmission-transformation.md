Author's term: the triad of post-juridical ethics for the statistical commons. Transparency: all generated code must be able to explain its logic (no black boxes). Transmission: facilitate appropriation by others through generous citation, documentation, and sharing (inherit the gift). Transformation: encourage creative mutation rather than servile reproduction; the fork as central political gesture (transform rather than copy).
