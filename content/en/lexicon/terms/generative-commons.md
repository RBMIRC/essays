Author's term: the dream, unlike property, is not exhausted in use. When one walks in a dream, one augments it—adds to its geography, extends its narrative, thickens its texture. Archives treated as shared dream become such a commons: each new project that activates them adds to the dream without diminishing it. Not a resource to share (where one person's use reduces another's) but a space enriched by each person's contributions. The more it is used, the more there is. (*Index*)
