Author's term: a new kind of archival relation where the distribution is preserved while the instances are dissolved. The classical archive preserves singulars retrievable at specific addresses: this document, in this box, on this shelf. The neural network preserves statistical regularities while individual photographs cannot be extracted—the distribution is learned, but no single training image can be recovered. Memory without singularity: the archive remembers patterns while forgetting particulars. (*The Image Continuum*)
