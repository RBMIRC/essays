Author's term: a pedagogical dispositif that institutes a situation of learning through collective making in contracted time. Defined by temporal compression (limited duration creating urgency) and gestural community (bodies working together in shared space). Not a method (which would specify procedures) but a material and social arrangement that configures possibilities for action. A form that produces knowledge impossible to obtain otherwise—knowledge that exists only in density, that cannot be achieved at lower intensity over longer duration. (*The Workshop as Form*)
