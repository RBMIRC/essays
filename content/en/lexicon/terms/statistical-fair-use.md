Author's term: proposed doctrine recognizing that probabilistic recombination constitutes sufficient transformation to escape derivative work claims. When less than 1% of outputs correspond verbatim to training data, when patterns from thousands of sources intertwine inextricably, traditional infringement analysis collapses. The question is not "did you copy this work?" but "can any single work be identified in the output?"—and the answer, given sufficient mixing, is no. (*Heredoc Manifesto*)
