Author's term: the enclosure movement against the statistical commons, deploying mechanisms across three registers. Legal enclosure: Copyright Office positions treating AI training as infringement, EU AI Act requiring data documentation. Technical enclosure: C2PA provenance standards, watermarking, weight fingerprinting that allows auditors to trace outputs back to training data. Economic enclosure: "open washing" (releasing weights while withholding training data), proprietary infrastructure that commoditizes the complement. The window enabling the statistical commons is temporary and closing. (*Ethics of the Statistical Commons*)
