French term maintained by Michel Foucault's translators to preserve its specific meaning: an arrangement or apparatus that configures what can appear, determines conditions of visibility, constrains certain operations and makes others possible. Not merely a device but a whole field of relations—discursive and material—that produces subjects and objects together. The workshop is a dispositif, not a method: it doesn't specify procedures but arranges conditions. (*The Workshop as Form*)
