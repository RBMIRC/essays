Experimental liberal arts college in North Carolina (1933–1957) founded on democratic self-governance and learning through making. Key figures include Josef and Anni Albers, John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Buckminster Fuller, Ruth Asawa, and Robert Rauschenberg. The college functioned without grades, with students and faculty governing together, and with arts at the center of the curriculum. Functions in this corpus not as a model to imitate but as an *operator* for thinking pedagogy otherwise—proof that radically different educational arrangements have existed and can exist again. (*The Workshop as Form*)
