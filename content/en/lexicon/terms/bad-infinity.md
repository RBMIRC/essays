G.W.F. Hegel's concept (*schlechte Unendlichkeit*): a degenerate infinity that merely repeats the same operation endlessly without achieving genuine completion—the number series extending forever, never reaching its destination. Applied to recursive AI systems: the Internet risks becoming a cemetery of simulacra where human history stops around 2023 (the approximate date of the end of clean corpora). A stagnant, self-reproducing echo chamber where models train on their own outputs in a bad infinity that degrades rather than develops. (*The Recursive Archive*)
