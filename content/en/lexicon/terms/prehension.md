Alfred North Whitehead's term: the fundamental mode of relation constituting reality. Each actual occasion prehends other occasions—feels them, grasps them, incorporates them into itself. Expanded beyond human consciousness to describe all relation: a cell prehends its chemical environment, a stone prehends the gravitational field, a pixel prehends adjacent pixels. "The activity of feeling continuity within discontinuity." Prehension names how discrete entities are nonetheless continuous—how they touch, affect, include one another. (*What is a Continuum?*)
