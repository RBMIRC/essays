Matteo Pasquinelli and Vladan Joler's concept: a critical instrument to break the myth of AI as autonomous entity. AI is not autonomous intelligence but an "instrument of knowledge amplification" (like the telescope or microscope) that transforms data masses into statistical models of perception. It does not think; it automates perception through knowledge compression. The nooscope makes visible the labor, data, and infrastructure that the term "artificial intelligence" obscures. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
