Author's term: a citational practice—explicitly marking where one reads from, acknowledging what structures one's encounter with the text. The reading position is not external to the reading—it is the space of possible transformation. By marking it, one acknowledges that different positions would produce different readings, that one's reading is not universal but situated, that other encounters remain possible. (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
