Technical enclosure mechanism that attaches cryptographically signed manifests to files, carrying authorship information and "Do Not Train" assertions. Part of what the corpus terms the *counter-reformation* against the statistical commons. Provenance crawlers scan the web to identify data lacking credentials, transforming the open internet into a gated community where only credentialed content circulates freely. The technology instantiates a particular politics of attribution that may foreclose alternative arrangements. (*Ethics of the Statistical Commons*)
