The argument that computation operates through pattern detection and therefore cannot generate authentic innovation. When AI processes an archive, it detects and reproduces statistical regularities—applying templates derived from existing data. Creativity, however, is often defined as disruption of regularities—the introduction of what the pattern did not predict. Bergson distinguished intelligence (which proceeds by analysis and recombination of fixed elements) from intuition (which grasps duration and *élan vital* directly). The question is whether pattern recognition can ever exceed its patterns. (*The Recursive Archive*)
