Michael Polanyi's concept: *we know more than we can tell*. Practical knowledge that cannot be completely stated in propositional form—the knowledge of how to ride a bicycle, how to recognize a face, how to judge when bread is properly kneaded. Transmitted through apprenticeship, proximity, immersion—not through explication of rules. The skilled practitioner cannot fully articulate what they know; the novice cannot learn simply by being told. (*The Workshop as Form*)
