Author's term: the diagram's fundamental operation—geometrizing thought, making ideas into points, relations into segments, understanding into traversing space. This operation possesses undeniable efficacy (complex relations become visible, patterns emerge, communication is facilitated) but imposes an implicit ontology of discrete entities and binary relations. Spatialization foregrounds certain aspects (position, connection, overview) while backgrounding others (intensity, duration, depth). (*Nodal Thinking*)
