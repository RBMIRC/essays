Donna Haraway's concept: all knowledge is produced from a particular position—a body marked by gender, race, class, history, institutional location, disciplinary training. Against the "god trick" of disembodied objectivity that claims to see from nowhere, situated knowledge acknowledges its partiality and takes responsibility for it. The exposed teacher assumes that what they teach is situated, produced from a specific trajectory they do not mask—not universal truth but located perspective. (*The Workshop as Form*)
