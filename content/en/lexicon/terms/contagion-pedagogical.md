Author's term: the mechanism by which attention, disposition, and ways of being are transmitted through proximity. By seeing someone pay attention in a certain way, one learns to pay attention in that way. Not explicit instruction but embodied transmission—what passes between bodies in shared space without being articulated in language. The exposed teacher transmits not only technique but a way of being in the face of uncertainty, difficulty, and not-knowing. (*The Workshop as Form*)
