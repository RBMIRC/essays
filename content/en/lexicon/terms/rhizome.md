Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's concept: a structure without fixed foundation, with principles of connection (any point can connect to any other), heterogeneity (different kinds of things can be connected), multiplicity (the rhizome is not a unity but a multiplicity that changes nature as it grows), and asignifying rupture (the rhizome can be broken and will start up again). Often invoked to describe diagrammatic practice, but the rhizome *works*—it is a mode of operation, not a representation. What students often produce is a contemplative rhizome—something to look at rather than something to think with. (*Nodal Thinking*)
