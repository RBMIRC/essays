Tiziana Terranova's concept (2000): the unpaid work users provide to platforms in exchange for access to services. Our queries, corrections, ratings, and preferences feed the recursive loops that train models—we labor to improve systems that profit others. Transindividuation (Stiegler) is also an extraction: we co-constitute ourselves with machines, but the value of this co-constitution is captured by infrastructure owners. (*The Recursive Archive*)
