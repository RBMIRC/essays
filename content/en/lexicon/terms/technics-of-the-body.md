Marcel Mauss's concept from his famous 1934 lecture: even the most ordinary gestures—walking, swimming, sleeping, eating—are socially transmitted techniques. The body is never raw biological given but always already shaped by social learning, marked by cultural patterns, trained by collective practice. Tracing a diagram falls within this gestural economy: the movement of the hand across the page is learned, shaped by tools, conditioned by surfaces. (*Nodal Thinking*)
