Author's term: a quality of cognitive experience where a concept resists immediate grasping, forcing return and reformulation. A concept has depth when it does not let itself be captured in a formula, when each encounter reveals new aspects, when understanding deepens rather than completing. The diagram, by its nature, tends to evacuate depth—it produces fluid connections, frictionless passages between nodes. What gets lost is the vertical dimension: the labor of dwelling with difficulty rather than moving past it. (*Nodal Thinking*)
