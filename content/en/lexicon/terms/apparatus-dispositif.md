Michel Foucault's concept: a material and social arrangement configuring possibilities for action. The apparatus is a heterogeneous ensemble of discourses, institutions, architectural forms, regulatory decisions, and administrative measures. The workshop is understood as an *apparatus of the exposed teacher*—a dispositif that makes certain pedagogical relations visible and necessary. Giorgio Agamben later expanded the concept to include "anything that has in some way the capacity to capture, orient, determine, intercept, model, control, or secure the gestures, behaviors, opinions, or discourses of living beings." (*The Workshop as Form*)
