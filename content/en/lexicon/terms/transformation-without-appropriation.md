Author's term: a navigable path between direct appropriation (taking without acknowledgment) and exoticization (admiring from a distance without engaging). The formulation: "Reading X has fundamentally altered my understanding. My work operates from my position, marked by my institutions and archives. But it is shaped by this encounter—not as supplement (adding to what I already am) but as destabilization of presuppositions (changing what I can think)." (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
