Author's term: the false belief that photography shows us the world directly, without interpretation. What Barthes in *Mythologies* called the mythological function: the process by which cultural constructions present themselves as natural facts. Photography is always constructed—framed, selected, processed—but the mythology presents it as transparent window. This mythology persists because it serves powerful interests: surveillance, identification, control all depend on treating photographs as evidence. (*The Image Continuum*)
