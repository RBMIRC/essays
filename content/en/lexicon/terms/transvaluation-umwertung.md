Boris Groys's adaptation of Nietzsche: artistic novelty lies not in inventing unprecedented objects but in displacing existing objects from one regime of value to another. Duchamp's urinal: not a new object but a new valuation of an existing object. The trajectory from photograph to generated image is a continuum of successive revaluations—each transformation changing what the image is by changing what it does. But the mutation at its heart: statistical revaluation without a revaluator, transformation without intention. (*The Image Continuum*)
