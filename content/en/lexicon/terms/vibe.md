Author's term (critical): the immediate aesthetic coherence that strikes without arguing in holographic media. The *vibe* shows what is already expected, what corresponds to the majority distribution. The image does not disturb, it confirms; it does not challenge, it soothes. Content is perceived as immediate totality; the origin of data is dissolved in model weights; information becomes ambient texture. The aesthetic correlate of the liquid archive: everything flows, nothing stands out, all is *vibe*. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
