Author's term: the process by which one particular cosmotechnics occupies the position of universality, against which all others appear as local, traditional, or pre-modern variations. Western technology presents itself as absence of cosmology—pure reason, scientific method, technological necessity. This apparent neutrality is itself a cosmotechnical position: the claim that technique can be separated from cosmos and morality is a specific (Western, modern) way of relating technique to world. (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
