Author's term: the deepest answer to the counter-reformation against the statistical commons. The commons escapes into substrates where enclosure mechanisms cannot follow. Seeds propagating through farmer networks carry no C2PA credentials; no watermark survives biological reproduction. Paper archives evade provenance crawlers; handwritten notes resist optical character recognition. The goal is material autonomy—capacity to produce what is needed regardless of what happens in digital governance. (*Ethics of the Statistical Commons*)
