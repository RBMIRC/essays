New Models' concept (Caroline Busta and Lil Internet): the affordances, limitations, and laws governing the traction, velocity, visibility, and permanence of content on digital platforms. Each platform possesses hardcoded laws—sorting algorithms, interface limitations, reward systems, content policies—that determine user behavior and content morphology as gravity determines movement of bodies. These laws are not natural but designed; they serve particular interests while presenting themselves as neutral infrastructure. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
