Author's term: an archive that diffracts rather than dissolves. Where the liquid archive merges everything into weighted average, the prismatic archive maintains gaps, preserves grain against smoothing, articulates technical gestures to explicit political project. Characterized by: explicit governance (who decides what is included, how it circulates), traceability of provenances (where each document comes from), maintenance of singularities (preserving what does not fit the average). *Dining Hall* attempts to be such a prismatic archive. (*The Workshop as Form*)
