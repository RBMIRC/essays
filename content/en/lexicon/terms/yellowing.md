Author's metaphor for model collapse, drawing on documented phenomenon of yellow/golden bias in AI-generated images (DALL-E, Midjourney, ChatGPT, 2025); visual symptom of distributional degradation where recursive training produces chromatic drift toward statistical means. Generated images tend toward dominant yellow/amber tint, excessive saturation, hyper-contrasted lighting. The model, mixing all colors toward a consensual average, produces this muddy tint—like mixing all paints yields brown. A symptom of entropic convergence toward the Mean: diversity collapses, distinctiveness dissolves, everything tends toward the same warm, generic, unobjectionable palette. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
