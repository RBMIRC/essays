Author's term: a proposed alternative to simple topology of positions. Not only: what are the nodes and how are they linked? But also: what is the thickness of each node? The density of each connection? Graphic conventions to represent this intensive dimension: size proportional to time invested, thickness proportional to argumentation robustness, color indicating degree of certainty. The intensity topology would make visible what the positional topology hides. (*Nodal Thinking*)
