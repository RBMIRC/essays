Author's term: what the diagram evacuates. A concept has depth when it resists immediate grasping—when it does not yield its meaning at first encounter, when returning to it reveals new aspects, when understanding requires sustained attention. The diagram produces fluid connections, frictionless passages between nodes. Paradoxically, this facilitation can obstruct learning: one learns through the effort of overcoming what does not give itself immediately. Resistance is pedagogically productive. (*Nodal Thinking*)
