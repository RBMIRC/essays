Scientific field aimed at creating systems capable of performing complex tasks. In the Heredoc Manifesto, it is a "pharmakon" (remedy and poison) and a political apparatus that structurally transforms intellectual property. AI becomes the mechanism through which private code transmutes into statistical commons, dissolving traditional notions of authorship and ownership. (*The Heredoc Manifesto*)
