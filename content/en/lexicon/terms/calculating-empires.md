Kate Crawford and Vladan Joler's project (2023) mapping the extractive genealogy of AI over five centuries, demonstrating that AI is not a rupture but the intensification of a long-duration colonial regime of classification, extraction, and control. The project visualizes connections between historical systems of domination and contemporary computational infrastructures. Awarded the Silver Lion at the Venice Architecture Biennale 2025. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
