Author's term: for proprietary creative works, the ethical valence when they enter AI training. Property dissolves against its will—this is neither straightforwardly good (liberation) nor bad (extraction) but ambivalent, requiring scrutiny of *cui bono* in each instance. The dissolution of one enclosure (copyright) may enable another (platform capture); the socialization of creative work may enrich corporations rather than creators. Subversion is not automatically progressive. (*Ethics of the Statistical Commons*)
