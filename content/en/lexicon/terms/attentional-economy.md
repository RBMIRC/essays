The contemporary regime in which attention becomes a rare resource, disputed and exploited. Yves Citton and others have analyzed how this regime favors scanning over deep reading, connection over deepening, velocity over reflection. The diagram is perfectly adapted to this economy: quickly produced, quickly consumed, quickly circulated. What gets lost is the slow work of dwelling with difficulty—the *vertical* labor that cannot be represented horizontally. (*Nodal Thinking*)
