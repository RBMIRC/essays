Gilbert Simondon's concept: the process by which individuals come to be, not as fixed entities but as ongoing becomings. Individuals are not given but produced through processes of individuation; they remain open to further transformation. The diagram is an operator of individuation, moving thought from confused nebula to articulated configuration—but it risks freezing what should continue to transform, treating intermediate stages as final states. (*Nodal Thinking*)
