Benjamin Bratton's concept: the planetary architecture of contemporary computation, organized in superimposed layers—Earth (mines, cables, data centers, the material substrate), Cloud (protocols, APIs, models, the logical layer), City (urban networks, infrastructure, sensors), Address (geolocation, identification, naming), Interface (screens, devices, interaction points), User (profiles, behaviors, data shadows). Each layer has its own geopolitics, its own modes of governance, its own forms of violence and possibility. (*The Recursive Archive*)
