Massive set of data (terabytes of code) used to train models. The Heredoc Manifesto emphasizes that the preponderance of open source sources (~60%) imbues the model with a "tropism toward sharing"—the statistical weight of collaborative code shapes the model's probabilistic behavior toward openness rather than closure. (*The Heredoc Manifesto*)
