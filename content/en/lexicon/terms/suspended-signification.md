Author's term: what happens to photographs in the archive. Meaningful in principle, awaiting an act of interpretation that may never occur. The photograph exists as potential document, available for retrieval but not currently retrieved, its meaning deferred into an indefinite future. Most archival photographs remain in this suspended state—preserved but not activated, available but not accessed, carrying latent significance that may never be realized. (*The Image Continuum*)
