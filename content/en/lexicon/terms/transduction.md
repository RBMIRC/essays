Gilbert Simondon's concept: a process where an activity propagates from neighbor to neighbor, each constituted region serving as primer for the next. Opposed to induction (generalizing from cases) and deduction (deriving from principles). Crystallization is transductive: each formed crystal serves as the seed for further crystallization. A transductive diagram would not be a finished map but an ongoing process of mapping—each traced element enabling further tracing. (*Nodal Thinking*)
