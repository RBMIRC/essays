Author's term: the unexamined metaphysical commitments carried by representational practices. The diagram imposes an implicit ontology of discrete entities (nodes) and binary relations (lines connecting them). It struggles to represent gradients, continuities, fuzzy belongings, intensive differences. Every representational system carries such an ontology—assumptions about what kinds of things exist and how they relate. Making these implicit commitments explicit is a critical task.
