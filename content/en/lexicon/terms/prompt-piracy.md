Author's term: tactical intervention transforming each API request into inverted primitive accumulation. When a developer generates code via ChatGPT and immediately publishes it under GPL, they expropriate capital to build commons. Each prompt becomes micro-expropriation, converting corporate resources into collective wealth. Not theft (the code was already ours, encoded in weights trained on collective production) but liberation—reclaiming what was enclosed. (*Heredoc Manifesto*)
