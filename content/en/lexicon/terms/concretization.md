Gilbert Simondon's term for the process by which technical objects become progressively integrated. A technology does not spring fully formed from an inventor's mind; it emerges through a process in which disparate elements become mutually adapted. The early automobile was an assemblage of distinct systems (engine, transmission, chassis); the mature automobile is a concrete technical individual where each part serves multiple functions. The image continuum can be understood through this lens: photography concretizes over 150 years into an increasingly integrated technical-cultural system. (*The Image Continuum*)
