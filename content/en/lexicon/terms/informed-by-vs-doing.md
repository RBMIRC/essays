Author's term: the distinction between being transformed by a corpus and claiming to do the work emerging from it. One can be profoundly influenced by Afrofuturist thought without claiming to do Afrofuturist work; one can learn from indigenous knowledge systems without claiming indigenous identity or authority. The influence is acknowledged, the debt marked, but the work remains one's own—transformed by encounter but not claiming to substitute for what encountered. (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
