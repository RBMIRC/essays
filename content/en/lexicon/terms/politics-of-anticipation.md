Yuk Hui's term for the new political regime when tertiary protention (externalized anticipation) displaces tertiary retention (externalized memory) as the dominant technical function. When machines anticipate our needs, predict our queries, recommend our next actions, we become passive consumers of a pre-calculated future. The archive is no longer a place we go to remember but a machine that tells us what we are going to do—foreclosing the future by predicting it. (*The Recursive Archive*)
