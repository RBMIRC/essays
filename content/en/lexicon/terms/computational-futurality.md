Author's term: the horizon opened (or foreclosed) by computational systems for imagining and producing futures. When tertiary protention (anticipation externalized in technical systems) becomes automated and dominant, it risks short-circuiting human capacity to imagine futures that differ from statistical projections of the past. The question becomes: can we maintain the capacity for genuine futurity—for futures that break with extrapolation—in an environment saturated with predictive systems? (*Index*, *Retcon Methodology*)
