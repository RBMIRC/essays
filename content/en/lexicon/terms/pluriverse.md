Arturo Escobar's concept from *Designs for the Pluriverse*: against the single universe of Western modernity, which claims universal validity for its categories and methods. The pluriverse is "a world where many worlds fit"—not relativism (all views equally valid) but radical interdependence (different worlds can coexist without being reduced to a common measure). Joins Yuk Hui's technodiversity but grounds it in concrete struggles for territorial autonomy—Zapatista communities, movements for *buen vivir*, indigenous peoples developing technical practices aiming not at optimization and growth but at sufficiency and relation. (*The Recursive Archive*)
