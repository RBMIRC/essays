Concept drawn from Charles Sanders Peirce and developed by Luciana Parisi in the context of machine learning: a mode of reasoning distinct from both deduction (drawing conclusions from premises) and induction (generalizing from observed examples). Abduction is a speculative engagement with error, contingency, and the unknown—"creating new explanatory hypotheses in the face of unknown phenomena." Machine learning systems operate through abduction, learning "from incomplete information" where "the incompleteness of models is a motor for speculative algorithms." Where induction presupposes knowable objects and fixed concepts, abduction involves constructing new hypotheses in the face of unknown phenomena. (*The Image Continuum*)
