Author's term: what occurs when language/image models are trained on massive corpora—private intellectual property is transformed through training into a shared probability distribution. The commons constitutes itself automatically, without deliberation, unlike traditional commons subject to negotiated rules. Value circulates without politics: recombination is only probabilistic, never decisional. No one decides what enters; no one governs how it is used. A commons by accident rather than intention, raising the question: can accidental commons become intentional ones? (*L'Archive Liquide*, *Index*)
