Martin Jay's term for the privileging of vision in Western thought. To understand is to see; to explain is to show; to think is to render visible. The diagram inscribes itself in this economy of visibility, promising to make visible what was obscure—but some things resist being mapped. The well cannot be diagrammed without becoming a line; the vertical cannot be represented without being flattened. Ocularcentrism forecloses what cannot be seen. (*Nodal Thinking*)
