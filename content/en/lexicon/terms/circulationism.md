Steyerl's term (2014) replacing Soviet productivism; value created not through making images but through post-producing, launching, and accelerating them across networks. Marks shift from production to circulation as site of meaning. The regime where the value of the digital image no longer resides in its content but in its circulation. The image does not need to be true, beautiful, or significant; it must circulate, generate engagement, feed recommendation algorithms. What matters is not what the image shows but how far it travels, how many nodes it touches, how much attention it captures. Content becomes secondary to velocity. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
