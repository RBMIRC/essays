Bernard Stiegler's concept (building on Simondon): the process by which individuals and collectives actively co-constitute each other through shared engagement with technical systems. Two regimes: passive consumption (proletarianization—being shaped by systems one does not understand) versus active adoption (genuine transindividuation—co-evolving with systems through critical engagement). The computational tool can become a scaffold supporting processes of transindividuation that surpass it—but only if approached with technical culture. (*The Recursive Archive*)
