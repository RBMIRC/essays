John Dewey's concept: a state of uncertainty, confusion, or conflict that interrupts habitual action and forces thinking. "Thinking does not appear spontaneously; it is always a response to something that resists." Without obstacle, no thought—only habit. The workshop multiplies these situations: compressed time, unfamiliar materials, collaboration with strangers, tools that do not behave as expected. Each friction is an invitation to think. (*The Workshop as Form*)
