Author's term: the capacity to interrogate tools, understand their presuppositions, perceive their effects on thought and action. The student who uses an image generator without understanding what it was trained on, whose labor produced it, what biases it encodes, is not a competent user—they are a blind consumer. Critical capability is not refusal of tools but informed engagement that maintains the capacity to question what the tool makes easy and what it forecloses. (*The Workshop as Form*)
