Roland Barthes's term for the *noeme* of photography: "what I see has been there." The photograph certifies presence, serving as a "certificate of presence" and "message without a code"—direct evidence of past existence. The light that touched the subject touched the film; the image is an index, a trace. The generated image inverts this logic: it is a "That-could-have-been" that certifies likelihood rather than presence. We pass from image-as-memory to image-as-prediction. (*The Image Continuum*, *L'Archive Liquide*)
