Author's term: what historical precedent provides—not a model to imitate, but proof that another pedagogy is possible. Black Mountain College does not tell us how to do it; it tells us that it *can be done*. Authorization works for students too: showing them that the teaching they receive is not the only possible form gives them tools for critique. The archive of experimental education authorizes present experimentation by demonstrating that alternatives have existed and can exist again. (*The Workshop as Form*)
