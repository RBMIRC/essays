Gilbert Simondon's concept: a familiarity with the schemas that traverse machines—understanding not just how to use technology but how it works, what it presupposes, how it might be otherwise. The response to technical alienation is not sovereign withdrawal (rejecting technology) but technical culture (understanding it). For generative AI, this means dissipating magical discourse ("artificial intelligence," machine "creativity," model "hallucinations") to reveal the technical reality: statistical operations on probability distributions.
