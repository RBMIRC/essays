Author's term: a set of strategies for engaging with bodies of thought without extraction. Includes: citing thinkers rather than claiming their cosmologies as one's own; citing for critique (engaging the argument) rather than for content (taking the concept); marking one's reading position; distinguishing amplification from extraction; reading *with* rather than reading *as*. Every citation is a political act that either reinforces or disrupts existing hierarchies of knowledge. (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
