Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar's concept from laboratory studies: the curves, tables, graphs, and diagrams that do not merely transcribe preexisting facts but participate in constituting them. The instrument produces an inscription; the inscription becomes evidence; accumulated evidence becomes fact. It is the inscriptions themselves that, through stabilization and serialization, eventually acquire the status of facts. The diagram is such an inscription—not recording thought but producing it. (*Nodal Thinking*)
