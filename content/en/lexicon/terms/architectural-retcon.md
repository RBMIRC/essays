Author's term: the operation of rereading a building from another present, discovering possibilities that its original designers had not foreseen. Installing experimental pedagogy in the Petite Écurie at Versailles constitutes an architectural retcon: the monarchical surveillance dispositif—designed for the king's horses to be visible from his windows—is diverted into a space for horizontal co-presence. The building's history is not erased but reactivated, its latent potentials made available for uses its builders could not have imagined. (*The Workshop as Form*)
