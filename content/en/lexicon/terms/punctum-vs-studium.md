Roland Barthes's distinction in *Camera Lucida*. The *studium* is cultural interpretation—what the photograph shows and means, what codes allow us to read. The *punctum* is the detail that "pricks" the viewer, escaping cultural coding, striking with unmediated force—the eruption of the singular that exceeds interpretation. The generated image learns the *studium* (genre conventions, compositional rules, iconographic patterns) while eliminating the *punctum* (singularity that falls outside the distribution, the detail that could not have been predicted). (*The Image Continuum*)
