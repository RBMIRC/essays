Edward Tufte's pejorative term for decorative visual overload in data visualization—gratuitous effects (3D rendering, excessive gridlines, ornamental elements) that divert attention from data. However, what Tufte condemns may become cognitive resources in investigation diagrams: overload, disorder, and redundancy can maintain open possibilities that premature clarity would close. The distinction between communication diagram and investigation diagram requires different evaluative criteria. (*Nodal Thinking*)
