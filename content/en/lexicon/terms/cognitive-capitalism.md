The regime analyzed by Yann Moulier-Boutang, Maurizio Lazzarato, and Franco "Bifo" Berardi in which attention, creativity, and cognitive capacity become primary sites of value extraction. This regime favors the diagram as optimized format: quickly produced, consumed, and circulated. The velocity of diagrammatic production corresponds to the demands of contemporary attentional economy—thought must be packageable, transmissible, immediately graspable. (*Nodal Thinking*)
