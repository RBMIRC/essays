Author's term: the perceptual markers that code an image as "photographic" rather than painted or drawn. Includes: depth of field and bokeh (the quality of out-of-focus areas), lens distortion and chromatic aberration, sensor noise with characteristic spatial distributions, motion blur following physical laws. The generator must learn to replicate these signatures to fool the discriminator. Generated images exhibit photographic qualia not because they were photographed but because they were trained on photographs—they inherit the marks of a process they never underwent.
