Author's term: neither imitation nor rupture—taking up a question in new conditions to see what it produces. The 2025 workshop does not reproduce that of 1945; it reinterprets it under different conditions. Past and present transform each other mutually: the present finds resources in the past; the past is revealed differently by present questions. Distinct from nostalgic restoration (which seeks to recreate what was) and from amnesia (which forgets what was). Reactivation acknowledges debt while insisting on transformation.
