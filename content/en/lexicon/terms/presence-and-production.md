Thomas Hirschhorn's concept: being physically present on the site, visible, vulnerable, working—not from above but in the midst. Distinguished from demagogic "participation" where the artist remains the author and the public provides labor or legitimacy. The artist is there, working, exposed to the same conditions as those they work with. Presence is not surveillance but solidarity; production is not exploitation but shared labor. (*The Workshop as Form*)
