Mark Fisher's concept drawn from Jacques Derrida (*Spectres de Marx*): the persistence of lost futures in the present. Archives of experimental projects like Black Mountain College preserve precisely such lost futures—unrealized possibilities that haunt the present, trajectories opened but not pursued, available for reactivation. Hauntology names both the melancholic condition (mourning what did not happen) and a method (attending to the spectral, the almost-realized, the still-possible). (*The Recursive Archive*, *Index*)
