W.E.H. Stanner's term to correct misunderstanding of Australian Aboriginal *Tjukurrpa* (often mistranslated as "Dreamtime"): not a distant past but a parallel reality structure where ancestors are continuously creating the world. The Dreamtime is not "long ago" but "always"—an ongoing process accessible through ritual, song, and proper relationship to country. The *Songlines* function as a distributed database requiring bodily maintenance: if the ritual is not performed, the land itself degrades. A radically different archival logic. (*The Recursive Archive*)
