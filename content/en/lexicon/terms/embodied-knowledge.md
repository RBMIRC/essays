Knowledge that is bodily, situated, and relational—acquired in the situation or not at all. Includes the draftsperson's gesture, the carpenter's eye, the architect's sense of proportions. Michael Polanyi showed that such knowledge cannot be completely stated in propositional form: "we know more than we can tell." The workshop is a site where these capabilities are acquired through practice, proximity, and repetition—not through explanation alone. (*The Workshop as Form*)
