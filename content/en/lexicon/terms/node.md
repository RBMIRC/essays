The basic unit of the diagram: a point, a concept, an element—something that can be labeled and connected. In knotted thinking, nodes often function as black boxes: labels manipulated without understanding their content. The concept becomes a counter in a game rather than a site of understanding. What is missing is the gesture of *unboxing*: opening the node to discover the space or labyrinth within, accepting that what one took for a point is in reality a territory requiring exploration. (*Nodal Thinking*)
