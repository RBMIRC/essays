Not a smooth and homogeneous substrate underlying discrete differences. Following Whitehead and Deleuze, the continuum is the relational field that generates both continuity and discontinuity through its own operations. It is *discontinuously continuous*: it produces ruptures and gaps while connecting across them. It is *intensive and full* rather than extensive and empty: the interval between discrete points is densely packed with incomputable information. The continuum is the incomputable surplus that makes relation possible—what computation must presuppose but cannot capture. (*What is a Continuum?*)
