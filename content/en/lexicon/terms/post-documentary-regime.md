Author's term: the condition where plausibility replaces reference as the criterion of image validity. Not merely a technical transformation (images can now be generated) but inseparable from a political crisis named "post-truth." Truth has never been simply given, always constructed and contested; what changes is the scale and speed of contestation, the availability of tools for producing plausible alternatives, the erosion of institutions that once stabilized reference.
