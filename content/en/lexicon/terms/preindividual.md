Gilbert Simondon's concept: the potential that exceeds every realized form, the fringe of indetermination that accompanies every individual. Individuals are never fully individuated; they carry with them a charge of preindividual potential available for further transformation. The diagram, by isolating entities as nodes, performs an ontological decision that forecloses this dimension—it treats individuals as complete rather than ongoing, finished rather than open. (*Nodal Thinking*)
