James Bridle's term (2011–2013) for the irruption of digital language into the physical world: pixelated cushions, buildings designed for satellite visibility, fractal camouflage, glitched textiles. The New Aesthetic sought to make visible the invisible infrastructure of computation—to show how digital systems see and shape the physical world. The aesthetic of current AI differs: not glitch but hyper-resolution, not pixelation but supernatural smoothing, not revelation of mediation but erasure of all traces of it. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
