Gilles Deleuze's term (reading Leibniz): tiny imperceptible foldings and unfoldings beneath the threshold of consciousness. Qualitatively different from ordinary perceptions, operating at speeds and scales consciousness cannot register. "Tiny folds that never stop folding and unfolding on the edges of juxtaposed areas, like a mist of folds." The continuum is woven from these microscopic events—infinitesimal variations that accumulate into perceptible differences. (*What is a Continuum?*)
