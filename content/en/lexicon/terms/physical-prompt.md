Author's term: a constraint that forces thinking otherwise—not a semantic prompt (words requesting output) but a material constraint that redirects thought. Time running out, a breaking tool, resisting material, the body's fatigue, an unexpected property of the medium. These are not obstacles to learning but learning itself—what forces departure from habit, what makes improvisation necessary. Distinguished from the semantic prompts to which AI responds. The teacher is the guardian of these frictions. (*The Workshop as Form*)
