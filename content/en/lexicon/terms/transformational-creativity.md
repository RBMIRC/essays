Margaret Boden's term: the capacity not only to generate new elements within an existing framework (combinatorial creativity) or to explore a framework's possibilities (exploratory creativity) but to dismantle, reconstruct, and redefine the framework itself. Requires the capacity to interrogate one's own conditions of operation—to question not only answers but questions. Current AI systems struggle with this: they extrapolate from preexisting data without questioning parameters, combining and exploring but not transforming. (*The Recursive Archive*)
