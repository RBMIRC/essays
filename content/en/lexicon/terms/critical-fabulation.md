Saidiya Hartman's method: a form of historical speculation that gives voice to those who left no trace in archives designed to record their subjugation. Responding to the impossibility of recovering enslaved lives except through the archives of their destruction—ship manifests, auction records, punishment logs—critical fabulation uses narrative imagination to gesture toward what the archive cannot contain. Neither pure fiction nor conventional history but a practice at their intersection. (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
