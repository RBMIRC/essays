Steyerl's term (2023) playing on "mean" as both mathematical average and cruelty; statistical composites in AI-generated images that erase singularity. Shows how generative models flatten difference into normative representations. AI regresses toward the most statistically probable photography—the average of what exists in the training set. The adversarial dynamic produces normalization that eliminates the *punctum* (Barthes's term for the singular detail that pricks the viewer). The generated face is convincing precisely because it is average, suppressing the weird, the marginal, the unprecedented in favor of a consensual visual norm. What cannot be averaged disappears. (*The Image Continuum*)
