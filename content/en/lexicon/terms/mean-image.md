Hito Steyerl's term: AI regresses toward the most statistically probable photography—the average of what exists in the training set. The adversarial dynamic produces normalization that eliminates the *punctum* (Barthes's term for the singular detail that pricks the viewer). The generated face is convincing precisely because it is average, suppressing the weird, the marginal, the unprecedented in favor of a consensual visual norm. What cannot be averaged disappears. (*The Image Continuum*)
