Author's term: the capacity to produce what is needed regardless of what happens in the digital sphere. Prioritizing domains where instantiation requires only low-tech means: seeds over pharmaceuticals (seeds self-replicate; drugs require industrial chemistry), paper archives over digital databases (paper survives without electricity), farmer networks over API access (human relationships persist when platforms fail). The goal is not only digital commons but independence from systems that can be enclosed or shut down. (*Ethics of the Statistical Commons*)
