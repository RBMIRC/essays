Project within the Retcon Black Mountain research: a search engine built from over 5,000 digitized books where only annotations appear in search results. The original text remains invisible; what emerges are traces of reading—underlinings, marginalia, comments, marks left by unknown readers. The tool inverts usual documentary research: one searches for what readers found rather than what authors wrote. A database of attention rather than content. (*The Workshop as Form*)
