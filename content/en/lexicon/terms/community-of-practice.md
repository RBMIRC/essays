Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger's term for a social space where knowledge circulates through *legitimate peripheral participation*—the novice learns by observing the expert, participating in activities at the margins, gradually moving toward fuller participation. Competencies are transmitted through proximity of bodies rather than explication of rules. The workshop constitutes such a community through the sharing of gestures, the visibility of process, the mutual adjustment of rhythms. (*The Workshop as Form*)
