Ivan Illich's concept: a tool that increases autonomy rather than creating dependency. Convivial tools can be used by anyone for purposes they determine themselves, without requiring specialized training or institutional mediation. Each infrastructure—digital or analog—should be interrogated according to this criterion: does it expand the user's capacity for self-determined action, or does it bind them more tightly to systems they cannot control or understand? (*The Workshop as Form*)
