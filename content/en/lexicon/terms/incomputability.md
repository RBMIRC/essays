Gregory Chaitin's demonstration from algorithmic information theory: within the binary—in the interval between 0 and 1—there lodges an irreducible infinity that exceeds all finite computation. The Omega number (Ω) is perfectly well-defined mathematically yet absolutely incomputable: its digits exist but no algorithm can generate them. The continuum is woven from such incomputable quantities—it exceeds what discrete processing can capture while being presupposed by every discrete operation. (*What is a Continuum?*)
