Aymara concept proposed by Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui to think what Western dialectics fails to grasp. Ch'ixi designates what is simultaneously one thing and its opposite—the gray that contains white and black without fusing them into a third term. Unlike Hegelian synthesis that resolves contradictions through sublation (*Aufhebung*), ch'ixi maintains tension, allowing contradictory elements to coexist productively. A ch'ixi archive would be a space of productive tension rather than reconciliation—holding together indigenous and colonial, analog and digital, preservation and transformation. (*The Recursive Archive*)
