The act of entirely copying a project to create one's own independent version. The fork maintains a genealogical link with the original while allowing autonomous evolution—a plant "cutting" in software form. The foundational practice of libre culture: copying a project to make it diverge, creating an independent branch that can develop in its own direction. The fork constitutes the central political gesture of the libre—the right to take what exists and transform it, to say "we will do it differently." Forking affirms the right to transform, to bifurcate, to create one's own trajectory from shared code. The anti-monopoly par excellence: no entity can control what can always be forked. (*Heredoc Manifesto*, *Ethics of the Statistical Commons*)
