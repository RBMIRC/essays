Author's term: what the generative model constitutes. Unlike photography (a memory prosthesis preserving past moments), the generative model produces possible moments that never occurred. It extends human imagination beyond the constraint of the past by generating possibilities rather than retrieving actualities. Imagination as pure operation, detached from any experiencing subject—a capacity to envision that operates without a body that envisions. (*The Image Continuum*)
