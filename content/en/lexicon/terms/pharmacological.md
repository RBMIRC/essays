Bernard Stiegler's concept following Jacques Derrida: every *pharmakon* is simultaneously poison and remedy, and it is use—informed, critical, collective—that decides what it becomes. Technology is pharmacological: it can cure or kill, liberate or enslave, depending on how it is practiced, governed, understood. The pharmacological approach refuses both technophobia (technology as pure threat) and technophilia (technology as pure solution), insisting instead on the undecidability that requires ongoing collective negotiation. (*The Workshop as Form*)
