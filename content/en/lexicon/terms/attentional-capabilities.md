Author's term: the capacity to perceive what counts and to maintain sustained attention in an environment designed to fragment it. Threatened by the attention economy, these capabilities require cultivation through slower, shared attentional regimes. Joint attention—perceiving the rhythm of a group, listening to someone working beside you, noticing what the teacher notices—cannot be learned before a screen. The workshop is a site where these capabilities can be deliberately developed through embodied practice. (*The Workshop as Form*)
