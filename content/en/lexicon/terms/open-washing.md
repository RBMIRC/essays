Author's term: economic enclosure strategy that deploys the rhetoric of openness while maintaining control. Releasing model weights (which anyone can download) while withholding training data (which no one can reproduce), code (which no one can audit), and alignment methodologies (which no one can verify). "Commoditizes the complement"—making the model free to drive demand for proprietary infrastructure (cloud computing, fine-tuning services, enterprise support). The community can use the model but cannot reproduce, audit, or escape dependency. (*Ethics of the Statistical Commons*)
