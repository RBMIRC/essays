Vilém Flusser's term: one who executes functions predetermined by the technical system. The operator of an apparatus who plays within its program, realizing possibilities that the apparatus has predefined but never exceeding them. "Photographers do not work, they play"—they explore the camera's pre-programmed possibilities. The *vibe coder* embodies this paradox intensified: orchestrating without composing, directing without writing, summoning statistical symphonies from the ocean of possibilities encoded in the model. (*Heredoc Manifesto*, *The Image Continuum*)
