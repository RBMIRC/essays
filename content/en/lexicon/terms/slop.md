Colloquial term adopted critically: the yellowed and generic visual spam of the AI era—content optimized for circulation, emptied of all semantic friction, perfectly adapted to flow. Generic product photos, AI influencers, content farm imagery—produced not to be looked at but to fill feeds, not to communicate but to circulate. The logical product of the economy of circulationism: images valued for velocity rather than meaning. The statistical hell of the "Mean"—everything converging toward average, nothing standing out, endless identical variations. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
