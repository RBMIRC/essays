Author's term: what the researcher becomes when haunted by an archive. One enters as a historian and emerges as something like a belated student of the institution—haunted by a pedagogy one never lived through but that continues to act. The syndrome observed in BMC researchers: Harris, Duberman, Danilowitz, and others become proxy students, apprentices to dead masters, learning from documents what should have been learned from presence.
