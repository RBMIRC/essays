Author's term: the quality that makes resistance comprehensible and therefore pedagogically productive. The friction of wood is immediately legible: one sees the material resist, one feels the necessary force, one can adjust the gesture accordingly. The friction of the algorithm is often opaque: the result is there but the reasons are hidden in statistical weights. The teacher's task includes translating opaque frictions into legible ones—making visible what the system obscures. (*The Workshop as Form*)
