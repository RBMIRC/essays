Author's term: a proposed pedagogical practice for diagram work. Trace a single connection between two concepts, then spend an hour explicating everything this connection implies, presupposes, enables. Make the line not a shortcut but a path to traverse step by step. The exercise would transform the gesture of connecting from a casual movement to a deliberate investigation, revealing what quick connections conceal. (*Nodal Thinking*)
