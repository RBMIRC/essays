Émile Durkheim's concept: the moment when the group transcends the sum of its members, when individual boundaries become porous and participants feel themselves part of something larger. "Vital energies are over-excited, passions more vivid, sensations stronger." This state presupposes physical co-presence, affective contagion, synchronization of bodies—everything that sequential processing of discrete data seems incapable of producing. The workshop aims to create conditions for such effervescence. (*The Recursive Archive*)
