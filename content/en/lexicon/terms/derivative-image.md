Hito Steyerl's concept from her essay "Mean Images": like financial derivatives, AI-generated images are statistical averages extracted from vast datasets. They are "social dreams without sleep"—condensations of what society pays attention to and nothing else. The derivative image reflects collective desire back at itself, amplifying what was already dominant in the training distribution. It has no referent in the world but only in the accumulated visual culture of the dataset. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
