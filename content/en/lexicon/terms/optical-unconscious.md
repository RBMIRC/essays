Walter Benjamin's concept: photography reveals structures of reality that the naked eye cannot grasp—decomposed movement (Muybridge), enlarged detail (microphotography), invisible spatial configurations (aerial photography). "The camera introduces us to unconscious optics as does psychoanalysis to unconscious impulses." In generative AI, latent space appears as the terminal, mathematized form of this unconscious—but the shift is radical: no longer exploring the physical world but the invisible correlations within data masses. See *Statistical Unconscious*. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
