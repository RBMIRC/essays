Author's pedagogical extension of Stiegler's concept (Bifurquer, 2020); where Stiegler theorizes systemic bifurcation against entropy, Author emphasizes individual/collective capacity to change direction radically within workshop conditions. The capacity to change direction, to break with an ongoing logic rather than optimizing within it. The algorithm does not bifurcate—it optimizes along predetermined dimensions. Workshop urgency paradoxically enables bifurcation: when one has only five days, one can allow oneself to change everything on the third. The temporal compression of the workshop creates conditions where radical redirection becomes possible precisely because there is no time for the gradual drift that characterizes longer projects. (*The Workshop as Form*)
