Luciana Parisi's term: involves parallel processing of binary characteristics that are neither contained within a unique lineage nor filiatively inheritable. Evolution proceeds not by inheritance (parent to offspring, linear descent) but by infection (horizontal transfer, contamination between unrelated lineages). The sum of symbiotic combination is "more than two, more than 0 and 1"—exceeding binary logic through the thickness of relation. (*What is a Continuum?*)
