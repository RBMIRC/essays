Author's term: the proposed response to the liquefaction of the archive. Against the smooth flow of statistical processing, reintroduce what the system eliminates: opacity (with Glissant, the right not to be understood by the machine), singularity (outliers the model considers "noise"), gap (voluntary error, assumed ambiguity). Friction is the condition of possibility for a politics of the image in the era of statistical commons—not resistance to technology but resistance within it, making the flows turbulent. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
