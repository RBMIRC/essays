Bruno Latour's term (drawing on cybernetics): an element whose internal complexity has been rendered invisible, that one manipulates as a compact unit without questioning its content. In diagrams, nodes often function as black boxes: floating signifiers that can be linked to other floating signifiers without generating new understanding. The connection between two black boxes produces only a third black box. The gesture of *unboxing*—opening the node to discover the space or labyrinth within—is what distinguishes investigation from mere arrangement. (*Nodal Thinking*)
