Author's term: a diagram participating in the elaboration of still-uncertain knowledge. The diagram of the research notebook, the whiteboard, the sketch on a napkin. Here the author does not yet know what they are trying to show—this is precisely why they trace. A heuristic tool, a discovery device, an aid to thinking rather than a representation of thought already completed. Distinguished from the *communication diagram*. (*Nodal Thinking*)
