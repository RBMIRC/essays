Luciana Parisi's term: "the infectious activities between parallel algorithms" allowing "acquisition of genetic material without direct genetic transfer." The continuum understood symbiotically is not smooth flow but viscous aggregation, a process of mutual infection connecting while preserving difference. Things gel without merging; they infect without fusing; they relate without becoming identical. (*What is a Continuum?*)
