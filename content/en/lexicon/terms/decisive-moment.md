Henri Cartier-Bresson's term for the photographic instant when eye, body, and apparatus converge to fix a fraction of a second. The economy of scarcity in documentary photography: one cannot photograph everything, one must choose, each exposure is a commitment. Generative AI inverts this economy entirely: the "click" becomes the "prompt," abundance replaces scarcity, infinite variations replace the irreversible instant. The decisive moment presupposes a mortal photographer in a world that will not wait. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
