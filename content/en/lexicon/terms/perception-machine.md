Joanna Zylinska's term: an assemblage of technical infrastructure, human perception, and social relations in which the distinction between image capture and image creation has become structurally blurred. We inhabit an automated imagination—a technical universe where image production increasingly proceeds without us, where cameras see without human eyes, where images generate images. The question becomes: what remains of human perception when machines do most of the perceiving? (*The Image Continuum*)
