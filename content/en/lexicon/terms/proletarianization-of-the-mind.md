Bernard Stiegler's term: the transfer of savoir-vivre (knowing how to live) and savoir-faire (knowing how to do) to machines. In the context of AI, it is not only technical know-how that is lost but the know-how of seeing itself. If the apparatus sees for us and decides the probability of a form, our capacity to exercise aesthetic judgment atrophies. We become consumers of images we cannot make, users of tools we do not understand, inhabitants of systems we cannot govern. (*L'Archive Liquide*, *The Recursive Archive*)
