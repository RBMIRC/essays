The reduction of a complex intellectual and political project to a visual or aesthetic resource available to enrich one's own production. One of two symmetrical pitfalls (along with direct appropriation) to avoid in citational practice. Exoticization treats difference as decoration—valued for its strangeness rather than its argument. The exotic other is not engaged as interlocutor but consumed as spectacle. (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
