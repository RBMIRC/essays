Rasheedah Phillips's term (Black Quantum Futurism): learning to decode the mechanisms by which time is stolen, predetermined, colonized—and to undo them. Not only analytical competence (understanding how temporal regimes work) but a practice of reappropriation (inventing other relationships to time). Temporal literacy includes recognizing how predictive systems foreclose futures, how historical narratives constrain presents, how certain populations are denied temporal sovereignty. (*The Workshop as Form*)
