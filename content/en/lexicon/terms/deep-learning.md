A subdomain of machine learning using multi-layered neural networks—"deep" referring to the number of layers between input and output. This depth enables learning of hierarchical representations (edges → shapes → objects → scenes) but makes extracting data provenance mathematically intractable. The deeper the network, the more thoroughly individual training instances are dissolved into statistical weight. Deep learning is what makes the statistical commons technically inevitable rather than merely economically convenient. (*Heredoc Manifesto*)
