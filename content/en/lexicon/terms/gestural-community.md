Author's term: the sharing of gestures that defines workshop practice. Where the individual project isolates each student (working alone, evaluated alone), the workshop creates a space where bodies work together, where gestures are visible to each other, where learning passes through observation and imitation. The gestural community is not a community of ideas (shared beliefs) but of practices (shared movements). (*The Workshop as Form*)
