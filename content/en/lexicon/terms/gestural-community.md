Author's term extending Agamben's gesture (Means Without Ends) to collective practice; community formed through shared physical actions rather than shared beliefs or identities. The sharing of gestures that defines workshop practice. Where the individual project isolates each student (working alone, evaluated alone), the workshop creates a space where bodies work together, where gestures are visible to each other, where learning passes through observation and imitation. The gestural community is not a community of ideas (shared beliefs) but of practices (shared movements). (*The Workshop as Form*)
