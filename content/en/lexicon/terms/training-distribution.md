Author's term: what the model actually learns—not "what faces look like" but "what faces looked like to the cameras that had the power to produce and preserve images." The distribution is shaped by colonial archives (who was photographed and by whom), commercial stock photography (what sells), surveillance infrastructure (who is watched), platform biases (what circulates). The generated image inherits this history while erasing its traces—reproducing biases while appearing neutral. (*The Image Continuum*)
