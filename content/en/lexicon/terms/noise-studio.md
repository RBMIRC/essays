Author's term: the acoustic dimension of the analog studio—conversations, rustling paper, falling materials, footsteps, adjustments. Not an obstacle to concentration but shared information. The noise synchronizes bodies without constraining them: one knows when others are working intensely (silence), when they are stuck (sighs, movement), when they have found something (exclamations, calling others over). The digital studio's silence fragments the perceptual milieu into sealed cells, interrupting tacit transmission. (*The Workshop as Form*)
