Māori concept of responsible guardianship: the guardian (*kaitiaki*) cares for a resource (*taonga* = treasure) without claiming ownership of it. Applied to data governance: data is a treasure of which one is guardian, not owner—held in trust for future generations, governed through collective responsibility. Part of the indigenous data sovereignty frameworks developed by Te Mana Raraunga (Māori Data Sovereignty Network). The model is not a linear production line but a virtuous recursivity that includes community governance at each loop. (*The Recursive Archive*)
