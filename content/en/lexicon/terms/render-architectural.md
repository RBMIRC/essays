The final stage where the architecture student gives form to their project for evaluation—the presentation image that shows what the building would look like if built. With generative AI, the render changes nature: no longer representing what one has designed but generating what one could have designed—and sometimes without ever thinking it. The student can produce images of projects they have not conceived, visualizations preceding (and potentially replacing) conception. (*The Workshop as Form*)
