Zygmunt Bauman's sociology: the passage from a "solid" phase of history (stable institutions, long-term employment, durable relationships) to a "fluid" phase where social forms decompose faster than they can be adopted as frames of reference. Power belongs no longer to those who control territory but to those who control flows—who can move, adapt, liquify, escape fixation. The liquid archive is the technological incarnation of this sociology. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
