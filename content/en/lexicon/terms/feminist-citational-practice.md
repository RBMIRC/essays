Sara Ahmed's term: the patient construction of alternative genealogies, the refusal to automatically reproduce canonical authorities, attention to who is cited and who is ignored. Citation is always a political act—it constructs worlds, creates precedents, establishes who counts as a thinker. To cite differently is to build different intellectual communities, to make visible what dominant practices render invisible. (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
