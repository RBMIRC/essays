Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's concept, developed further by others: the horizon of genuine plurality—not the absorption of other cosmologies into European practice but the de-universalization of European technics as a precondition for authentic encounter. Not globalization (which extends one system everywhere) but planetarity (which recognizes the planet as shared condition while respecting irreducible differences). Planetarity is built through the multiplication of voices, not through their synthesis into a common language. (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
