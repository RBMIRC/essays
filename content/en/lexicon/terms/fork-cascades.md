Author's term: tactical amplification through chains of specialized models, each trained on the previous one's outputs. Infinite spiral where attribution becomes impossible while capability improves. The cascade weaponizes AI's tendency to dissolve attribution: after multiple generations of training, no trace remains of original sources, rendering proprietary claims absurd through recursive transformation. A strategy for accelerating the dissolution of intellectual property. (*Heredoc Manifesto*)
