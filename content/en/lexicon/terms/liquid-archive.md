Author's term: the regime where everything merges into weighted average, where minority perspectives disappear into dominant distribution, where the recursive query runs without termination condition. The term designates a change of state from solid (form that resists pressure, maintains shape under stress) to liquid (takes the shape of its container, flows to fill available space). The archive no longer has its own form; it takes the form of the devices that process it. Everything becomes flow. (*L'Archive Liquide*, *Index*, *The Recursive Archive*)
