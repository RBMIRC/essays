What happens when models are trained on synthetic data generated by previous models. Shumailov et al. speak of "model autophagy disorder"—by analogy with prion diseases where misfolded proteins cause other proteins to misfold. After five to seven generations of recursive training, the model produces "degenerate" results: total loss of semantic nuance, convergence toward average, disappearance of the tails of distribution. Not only a technical risk but the symptom of a system that, lacking new human inputs to extract, begins to devour itself. (*L'Archive Liquide*, *The Recursive Archive*)
