Author's term, inflecting Simondon for the passage between heterogeneous semiotic regimes. Text (regime of meaning) becomes token (regime of segmentation), then vector (regime of geometry), then probability (regime of calculation). At each stage, something is lost and something is produced. What is lost: context, intention, enunciative situation. What is produced: patterns, regularities, correlations invisible to the human eye. The transductive chain transforms but does not preserve—each passage is irreversible. (*Index*)
