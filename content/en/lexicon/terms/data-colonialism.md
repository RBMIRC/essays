Nick Couldry and Ulises Mejias's term: the extension of colonial logic to human social existence, treating data generated by everyday life as resource to be extracted without consent. Like historical colonialism's appropriation of land and labor, data colonialism claims territory (the domain of human experience), extracts value (behavioral data), and imposes new forms of dependence (platform capitalism). For personal data, the statistical commons concept does not apply—what occurs is violation regardless of subsequent use. (*Ethics of the Statistical Commons*)
