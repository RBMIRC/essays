Author's term: what the teacher becomes in the workshop—navigating between heterogeneous temporalities (machine time, body time, ancestral time, project time), synchronizing when necessary, desynchronizing when fruitful. Not merely a "brake" against acceleration (slowing down) but a manager of temporal interference—knowing when to speed up and when to slow down, when to synchronize and when to let rhythms diverge.
