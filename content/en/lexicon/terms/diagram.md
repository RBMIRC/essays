Charles Sanders Peirce's insight: not a simple illustration of thought but a mode of thought itself. The diagram exhibits relations; it is intrinsically relational. But this relationality can become empty formalism when nodes function as black boxes and connections are traced without understanding what they connect. Two regimes must be distinguished: the *communication diagram* (transmitting stabilized knowledge) and the *investigation diagram* (participating in discovery). The diagram can become an epistemic simulacrum when it substitutes for the real work of understanding. (*Nodal Thinking*)
