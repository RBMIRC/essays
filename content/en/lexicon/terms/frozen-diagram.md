Author's term: a diagram that, once traced, becomes monument rather than instrument. Lacks the manipulation and experimentation that Peirce demanded of diagrammatic reasoning. What students often produce—a contemplative rhizome rather than an operative one, something to look at rather than something to think with. The frozen diagram displays conclusions rather than enabling further discovery. (*Nodal Thinking*)
