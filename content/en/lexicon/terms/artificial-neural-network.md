A computational architecture composed of layers of interconnected "neurons"—mathematical functions that receive inputs, apply weights, and pass results to subsequent layers. The network learns by adjusting these weights through training. It is in the connections between neurons that collective knowledge compresses: billions of parameters encoding statistical correlations extracted from training data. The neural network is not a brain (despite the metaphor) but a mathematical structure for pattern detection and generation. (*Heredoc Manifesto*)
