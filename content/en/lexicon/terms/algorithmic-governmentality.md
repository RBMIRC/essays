Antoinette Rouvroy's concept: a mode of power operating not through discipline (Foucault) or normalization but through statistical modeling of behavioral possibilities. Contemporary systems "short-circuit subjectivity," addressing individuals only as aggregates of correlatable data points. This regime produces a statistical reality that preempts events before they occur—governance through probability rather than law, prediction rather than prohibition. The archive under this regime becomes not a repository of the past but an instrument of anticipation. (*The Recursive Archive*, *Index*)
