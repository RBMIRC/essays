Technology understood as extension of the human organism beyond its biological limits—what André Leroi-Gourhan called "exteriorization." Photography is an exosomatic memory organ: it remembers what the brain cannot, preserving visual information across time. The generative model transforms this function—it does not simply store or retrieve memories but produces new images from the statistical structure of accumulated memories. An imagination prosthesis rather than a memory prosthesis. (*The Image Continuum*)
