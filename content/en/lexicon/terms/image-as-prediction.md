Author's term: the transformation from image-as-memory to image that no longer looks toward the past but toward the probability distribution of the future. The photograph indexed what was; the generated image models what could be. The image-as-prediction evacuates human finitude in favor of statistical eternity—no longer indexed to a moment that occurred but to a space of possibilities without a date. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
