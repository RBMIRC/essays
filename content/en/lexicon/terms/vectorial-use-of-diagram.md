Author's term: distinguished from topological use. Topology concerns relative positions and connections (what is next to what, what links to what). Vectorial use concerns directions and intensities: what does this tend toward? With what force? What attracts and what repels? Student practice remains massively topological; the vectorial dimension—thinking dynamics, tensions, gradients of force—is largely unexplored. (*Nodal Thinking*)
