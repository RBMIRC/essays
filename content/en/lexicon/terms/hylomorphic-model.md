The Aristotelian conception of making where form preexists in the creator's mind and is then imposed on passive matter. The model of the engineer, the industrial designer—and of generative AI, which "applies" a prompt to statistical matter. Tim Ingold opposes this to *correspondence*: making as dialogue with materials rather than imposition upon them. The hylomorphic model assumes the maker knows what they want before they begin; correspondence discovers what is possible through the encounter. (*The Workshop as Form*)
