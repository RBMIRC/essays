The overall form or configuration that emerges from the arrangement of parts—the whole that exceeds the sum of its elements. In the context of generative AI, Wolfgang Ernst diagnoses a shift from the archive as gestalt (stable form, fixed repository) to the archive as process (dynamic flux, continuous transformation): "The static residential archive as permanent storage is replaced by dynamic temporal storage." What was noun becomes verb. (*Index*)
