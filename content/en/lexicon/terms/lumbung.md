Indonesian (Javanese) term for communal rice barn where resources are pooled and redistributed according to collectively negotiated rules. Concept developed by ruangrupa for documenta 15 (2022): the teacher as maintainer is inspired by this model—not the owner who decides allocation but the guardian who ensures sharing rules are respected, who maintains the infrastructure of commons without claiming to possess what passes through it. (*The Workshop as Form*)
