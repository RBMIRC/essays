Māori concept of genealogical interconnection: all things have genealogy, provenance, relations—including data. Part of the indigenous data sovereignty frameworks that contrast with dominant extractivism by insisting on relational responsibility rather than treating data as resources to exploit. Whakapapa positions humans not as owners of data but as participants in networks of relation that include ancestors, descendants, and the more-than-human world. (*The Recursive Archive*)
