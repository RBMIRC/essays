Vilém Flusser's concept from *Towards a Philosophy of Photography*: technical images are produced by apparatuses whose programmed possibilities the photographer explores. "Photographers do not work, they play" with combinations offered by their camera's program—exploring possibilities that the apparatus has predefined. This intuition finds its culmination in generative AI, where the Flusserian photographer becomes the prompter, exploring the space of possibilities encoded in model weights. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
