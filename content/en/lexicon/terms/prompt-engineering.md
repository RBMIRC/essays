The practice of formulating optimal instructions to obtain desired results from language models—crafting queries that reliably elicit particular outputs. The prompt becomes what the corpus calls "the new literacy": the capacity to speak effectively to statistical systems, to navigate latent space through natural language. Prompt engineering is an "incantation" addressed to compressed collective intelligence—not programming in the traditional sense but a form of dialogue with probability distributions. Heritage prompts (collections of effective queries shared as community resources) constitute a new layer of commons above the model itself. (*Heredoc Manifesto*)
