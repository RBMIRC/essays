Shoshana Zuboff's term: a regime that extracts behavioral surplus from human activity, converting lived experience into predictive commodities. Creates a division of learning: corporations accumulate knowledge about populations while populations remain ignorant of what is known about them. Directly threatens conditions of collective self-narration—the capacity of communities to tell their own stories, to interpret their own archives, to shape their own futures. (*The Recursive Archive*, *Index*)
