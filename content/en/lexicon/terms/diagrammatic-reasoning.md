Charles Sanders Peirce's concept: the diagram as operative mode of thought, not mere representation. Diagrammatic reasoning requires manipulation—transforming the diagram, modifying elements, observing what happens. The Peircean diagram is dynamic; it is a tool for experimentation, not a picture to be contemplated. Frozen diagrams become monuments rather than instruments—they display conclusions rather than enabling discovery. (*Nodal Thinking*)
