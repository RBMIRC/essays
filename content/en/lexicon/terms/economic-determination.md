Author's term: the thesis that the statistical commons emerges not because AI must dissolve property, but because preserving attribution costs too much. Compression is not optional but necessary: to optimize prediction, the model must compress; to compress, it must abstract; to abstract, it must dissolve attribution. Capitalism chooses the architecture that maximizes profit; the architecture that maximizes profit happens to dissolve intellectual property into statistical weight. Capitalism inadvertently creates the infrastructure of its own socialization. (*Heredoc Manifesto*, *Ethics of the Statistical Commons*)
