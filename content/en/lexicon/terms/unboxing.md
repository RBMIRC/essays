Author's theoretical term (distinct from consumer "unboxing" videos); opening Latour's black box to reveal internal complexity, but emphasizing the pedagogical act of exposure rather than mere technical analysis. The gesture inverse to diagrammatic boxing—opening the node, unfolding its content, accepting that what one took for a point is in reality a space, even a labyrinth. What knotted thinking typically lacks: the willingness to descend into the node, to discover that it contains complexities the label obscured. Unboxing transforms the diagram from map to journey, from overview to exploration. (*Nodal Thinking*)
