Author's term: the gesture inverse to diagrammatic boxing—opening the node, unfolding its content, accepting that what one took for a point is in reality a space, even a labyrinth. What knotted thinking typically lacks: the willingness to descend into the node, to discover that it contains complexities the label obscured. Unboxing transforms the diagram from map to journey, from overview to exploration. (*Nodal Thinking*)
