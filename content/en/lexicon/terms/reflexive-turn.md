Author's term: the alternative to looking outward for plurality—turning reflexively inward to make visible the cosmological presuppositions already inscribed in one's own practice, tools, and institutional situation. Precondition for genuine dialogue: without it, there is only appropriation (taking from others) or exoticization (admiring others' difference). The reflexive turn asks not "what can I learn from them?" but "what do I assume that prevents genuine encounter?" (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
