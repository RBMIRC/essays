Author's term for images without indexical structure; neither "fake" (implying a true original) nor "synthetic" (implying artificiality), but operating in a different ontological register altogether. An image that comes after the indexical dispensation, presupposing the history of photography and inheriting its visual conventions, but liberated from the indexical constraint. Resembles a trace but is not a trace; presents the form of memory without the substance; simulates singular existence without referring to any singular. The generated image is structurally *punctum*-less: it learns the cultural codes (*studium*) while eliminating the singular detail that escapes coding. (*The Image Continuum*)
