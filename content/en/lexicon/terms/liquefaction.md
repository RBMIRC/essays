Author's term: the transformation of the archive from sediment to flux. Three mutations converge: mass digitization (which tears documents from physical contexts and makes them universally transmissible), generability (LLMs produce text from statistical distributions rather than retrieving fixed documents), and viral circulation (which exceeds any possibility of tracing provenance or controlling distribution). The archive ceases to be only what has been preserved; it becomes what can be generated. (*Index*)
