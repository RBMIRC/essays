New Models' term (Caroline Busta and Lil Internet) for the shift from Newtonian platform physics (Web 2.0, with clear force vectors like the "like" button) to a physics of simultaneity and entanglement. In holographic media, information is not a line but a cloud of probabilities; each generated image contains the "DNA" of the entire dataset. One no longer looks at a scene (a representation of something)—one looks at a *vibe* (a statistical condensation of everything). (*L'Archive Liquide*)
