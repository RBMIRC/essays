Author's term: not a general methodology but an ethics negotiated singularly in each encounter across epistemic difference. Research-creation is not the application of pre-existing theory (which would impose one framework on all situations) but the patient elaboration of a practice that assumes its partiality (which responds to each situation in its specificity). What is ethical in one encounter may not be in another; responsibility requires attention to singularity. (*De-Universalizing Technics*)
