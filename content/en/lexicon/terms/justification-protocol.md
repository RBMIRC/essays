Author's term: a proposed pedagogical practice for diagram work. Each line traced in a diagram must be accompanied by a text explicating the nature of the relation—not a keyword but a paragraph arguing the link. This would slow the gesture of tracing (forcing reflection before connection), reveal empty connections (links that cannot be justified), and transform the diagram from display to argument.
