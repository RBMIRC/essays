Author's term: resistance that forces thought. Not necessarily physical—the bug one does not understand, the archive that does not answer the question, the algorithm producing aberrant results are all frictions. What distinguishes frictions pedagogically is their legibility: the friction of wood is immediately perceptible (one sees the resistance, feels the necessary force); the friction of the algorithm is often opaque (the result is there but the reasons are hidden). The teacher's task includes making invisible frictions visible. (*The Workshop as Form*)
