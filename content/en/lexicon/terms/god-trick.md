Donna Haraway's term for the pretension to see from nowhere—the disembodied objectivity that claims universal vision while concealing its particular position. The god trick presents located, partial knowledge as if it were total and neutral. Haraway opposes to it "situated knowledges" that assume their positionality and take responsibility for it. The exposed teacher counters the god trick by saying where they speak from—their training, their limits, their stakes. (*The Workshop as Form*, *L'Archive Liquide*)
