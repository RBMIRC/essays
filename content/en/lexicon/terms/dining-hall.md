Decentralized archive system developed within the Retcon Black Mountain project, using blockchain and peer-to-peer protocols (IPFS, OrbitDB). Documents are distributed on a network of peers rather than stored on a central server controlled by a single entity. Each participant holds a partial copy; the whole exists only in the network. An infrastructure that is both technical and political—refusing that collective memory depend on proprietary platforms, venture capital, or corporate continuity. (*The Workshop as Form*)
