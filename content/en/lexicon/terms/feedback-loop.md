A system where output returns to affect input. In first-order cybernetics (Wiener), the loop enables self-regulation—the thermostat maintaining temperature. In second-order cybernetics (von Foerster, Maturana, Varela), the observer is included in the loop: observations modify the system, the modified system modifies observations. The Retcon Black Mountain project coils upon itself in successive loops—each iteration of research, workshop, documentation feeding into the next, each relaunching the others. (*Index*)
