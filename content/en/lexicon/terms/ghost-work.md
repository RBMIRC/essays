Mary L. Gray and Siddharth Suri's term: the invisible labor force of moderators, annotators, content reviewers, and micro-workers who "clean" the data that feeds AI systems. They label images, filter toxic content, correct hallucinations, verify outputs—providing the human judgment that makes AI systems appear intelligent. The transparency of the generated image is proportional to the opacity of the labor necessary to produce it. These workers are structurally invisible: their contributions are absorbed into statistical weights, their labor conditions hidden from users. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
