Schröter's term (2023) transposing Benjamin's Optical Unconscious to AI image generation; what machine learning reveals in aggregate patterns that escapes conscious human perception. Where Benjamin's camera revealed hidden gestures, AI reveals hidden distributions. No longer exploring the hidden structures of the physical world (what the camera reveals about movement, space, matter) but the invisible correlations within data masses (what patterns exist in accumulated visual culture). What AI reveals is not a materiality of the world but a logic of representation—not how things look but how looking has been encoded. The eye no longer looks at the object; it looks at the way culture has looked at the object. (*L'Archive Liquide*)
