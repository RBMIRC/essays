Framework developed by scholars including Tahu Kukutai and John Taylor, establishing principles for indigenous communities to govern data about themselves and their territories. The principles contrast radically with dominant extractivism: data are not resources to exploit but relations to maintain. Māori concepts like *Whakapapa* (genealogical interconnection) and *Kaitiakitanga* (responsible guardianship) reframe data governance through relational responsibility rather than property rights. (*The Recursive Archive*)
