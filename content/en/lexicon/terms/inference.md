The phase where a trained model generates new data (text, code, images) in response to a prompt. Distinguished from training (learning from data) by its direction: training moves from data to weights; inference moves from weights to output. Inference is probabilistic: the model samples from a distribution of possible continuations. This is how AI "manufactures public domain"—generating outputs that cannot be traced to any single source because they are statistical interpolations across millions of sources. (*Heredoc Manifesto*)
