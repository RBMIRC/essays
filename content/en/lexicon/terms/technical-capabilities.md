Author's term: mastery of gestures and know-how. Richard Sennett has shown that the intelligence of the hand is not an archaic residue but an irreducible form of thought—thinking through making, cognition distributed across body and tool. The workshop is the site where these capabilities are acquired in their embodied form, through repetition, correction, and gradual refinement. (*The Workshop as Form*)
