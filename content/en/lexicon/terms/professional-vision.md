Charles Goodwin's concept from ethnomethodology: how practitioners learn to see together, by pointing, annotating, and manipulating shared representations. Seeing scientifically is not a natural gift but an acquired competence, a labor of the gaze learned through prolonged contact with images and instruments in the company of those who already know how to see. The diagram functions as a site of professional vision: around it, practitioners coordinate their attention. (*Nodal Thinking*)
