Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum's concept: not the resources possessed but what persons can effectively do and be. Capability is not an attribute of the isolated subject but a possibility of action that certain conditions open or close. The workshop develops four orders of capabilities: critical (interrogating tools and their presuppositions), technical (mastery of gestures and know-how), attentional (sustained focus and joint attention), and bifurcatory (capacity to change direction). (*The Workshop as Form*)
