Author's term: the technical manifestation of *retcon*. When a generative model is fed partial archives, it fills gaps by applying statistical continuity, producing "retroactive continuity" where the historical archive presents discontinuity. Not a malfunction but a structural feature—a symptom of a regime where plausibility replaces reference. The model does not retrieve what was but generates what could have been, with no mechanism to distinguish the two. (*Index*)
