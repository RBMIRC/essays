Transposition of clinical "hallucination" to computational systems; describes AI filling archival gaps through statistical continuity, producing plausible but unfounded outputs. Term circulating in AI discourse; Author's specific application to archival theory. When a generative model is fed partial archives, it fills gaps by applying statistical continuity, producing "retroactive continuity" where the historical archive presents discontinuity. Not a malfunction but a structural feature—a symptom of a regime where plausibility replaces reference. The model does not retrieve what was but generates what could have been, with no mechanism to distinguish the two. (*Index*)
