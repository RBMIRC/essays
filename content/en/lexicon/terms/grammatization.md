Bernard Stiegler's term: the discretization of continuous flows into manipulable units. Writing grammatizes speech (continuous sound becomes discrete letters); printing grammatizes writing (scribal variation becomes standardized type); digital encoding grammatizes everything (analog signals become discrete samples). The diagram participates in grammatization by making thought visible, controllable, evaluable—but this visibility implies a dimension of cognitive surveillance, a making-amenable-to-examination. (*Nodal Thinking*)
