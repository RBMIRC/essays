See *Line vs. Well*. Digging a well: staying at one point but descending, accepting progressive obscurity (it gets darker the deeper you go), the narrowing of the field of vision, the patience of stratigraphy. A photographic metaphor: closed diaphragm, more focused, but with great depth of field. The well-digger does not move across the surface but into the ground—exchanging breadth for depth, connection for understanding. (*Nodal Thinking*)
