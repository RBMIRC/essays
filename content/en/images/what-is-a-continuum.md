## Introduction

The concept of the continuum has long troubled Western thought. From Zeno's paradoxes to contemporary debates in digital theory, the question of how discrete elements relate to continuous processes remains unresolved. In her 2009 article "Symbiotic Architecture: Prehending Digitality," Luciana Parisi proposes a reconceptualization of the continuum that refuses the opposition between the discrete and the continuous, the digital and the analog. Drawing on Alfred North Whitehead's process philosophy, the Deleuzian reading of Leibniz, Gregory Chaitin's algorithmic information theory, and Lynn Margulis's endosymbiotic biology, Parisi articulates a concept of the continuum as relational, intensive, and fundamentally incomputable. This text examines Parisi's theoretical construction in order to extract an operative definition of the continuum adequate to the contemporary conditions of computational mediation; and serves as a preamble to another text, "Image Continuum."

## Beyond Binary Opposition

Luciana Parisi's intervention begins with a refusal. In discourses on digital culture—whether critical, apologetic, or simply descriptive—a binary opposition structures most analyses: the analog against the digital, the continuous against the discrete. On one side, the sinusoidal curve of the analog electrical signal, a continuous variation of voltage that follows the phenomenon it represents. On the other, the binary logic of computational processing—0 and 1, sampling that slices the flow into discrete values, quantization that rounds each measurement. This dichotomy seems self-evident: it organizes our intuitions about what distinguishes old media from new, warm from cold, the organic from the machinic.

Yet Parisi argues that this opposition obscures more than it reveals. It prevents us from thinking what is actually at stake in contemporary computational systems. The epochal condition of digital culture is not the victory of one term over the other but rather their intricate coexistence: "a fuzzy mathematical logic of computation that defies any easy resolution into an aesthetics of continuity or discontinuity, a superiority of the analog or the meta-logic of the digital" (PARISI, 2009, p. 350).

This coexistence is neither compromise nor synthesis. It is not a meeting halfway between the continuous and the discrete, where each would cede ground to the other—as if one could dose the proportions, a bit more fluidity here, a bit more segmentation there. Parisi suggests something more radical: the discrete and the continuous are always already implicated in one another. Discontinuity emerges from continuity; continuity persists within discontinuity.

A simple example: when an analog-to-digital converter samples a sound signal, it extracts discrete values at regular intervals. But between two samples, the signal has not ceased to exist—it continues, indifferent to the segmentation imposed upon it. And conversely, the series of discrete values, once reconverted into an electrical signal, becomes a continuous curve again. The discrete does not replace the continuous; it inhabits it, traverses it, emerges from it and returns to it.

The continuum, from this perspective, is therefore neither the smooth substrate that would underlie discrete differences, nor the void that would separate isolated points. It is the relational field that generates both continuity and discontinuity through its own operations—not a neutral background upon which distinctions would come to rest, but the very dynamic that produces them.

## Whitehead: Extension as Relation

The philosophical foundation of Parisi's argument lies in Whitehead's concept of the extensive continuum, developed primarily in *Process and Reality* (1978) and *The Concept of Nature* (2004). Alfred North Whitehead, a mathematician turned philosopher, constructed a metaphysics in which the real is not made of stable substances but of processes in becoming. For Whitehead, extension names the most general scheme of real potentiality—the way each fragment of reality extends toward other fragments, touches them, affects them and is affected by them in return. All actual occasions—Whitehead's term for the fundamental units of reality, which can be conceived as ephemeral "drops of experience" rather than inert atoms—are internally and externally extensive; they stretch toward other occasions, incorporate them, and are incorporated by them in return (WHITEHEAD, 1978, pp. 67, 77).

A crucial point: Whitehead refuses to grant priority to space or time as a fundamental category of experience. Where the Western philosophical tradition—from Newton to Kant—posited space and time as preexisting frameworks within which events would come to lodge themselves, Whitehead reverses the perspective. There is, he argues, "primarily neither time nor space to experience, but rather a relation of extension between events" (cited in PARISI, 2009, p. 352). Space and time are derived abstractions, secondary to the more fundamental relation of extensiveness that connects actual occasions. In other words: it is not that events occur *within* space-time; it is the relation between events that *produces* what we call space and time.

This relation is not static but energetic; the Latin root of extension, *extendo*, implies stretching, unfolding, tension, and effort. The extensive continuum is not a passive container—an empty box waiting to be filled—but an active field of relations, a dynamic of tensions and connections.

What makes Whitehead's concept particularly relevant for Parisi's project is his insistence on what she calls "discontinuous continuity" (PARISI, 2009, p. 353). The extensive propagation of energy is an activity of divisible successive events, by which earlier events become part of larger events. The continuum does not supplant discontinuity; it engenders it. This is where Whitehead distinguishes himself from thinkers of pure continuity (such as Bergson) as much as from atomists: discrete events emerge from continuous relations and remain nested within them, so that the continuous and the discontinuous turn out to be two aspects of the same process rather than opposed categories.

Whitehead's concept of prehension provides the experiential dimension of this extensive relationality. Each actual occasion prehends other occasions—it feels them, grasps them, incorporates them into its own becoming. The term, coined by Whitehead from the Latin *prehendere* (to grasp), designates a form of perception expanded well beyond human consciousness: a cell prehends its chemical environment, a stone prehends the gravitational field, a pixel prehends adjacent pixels. This prehension is not representation or cognition in the narrow sense; it is the fundamental mode of relation that constitutes reality as such. The continuity of nature is found in events extensively connected in their intrinsic and extrinsic physical and conceptual relations (WHITEHEAD, 1978, p. 288).

For Parisi, this means that the continuum must be understood not simply as a formal or mathematical structure—an abstract schema that one would superimpose on the real—but as a felt, sensed, lived relation at all levels of reality. Following William James, she insists that "for a relation to be real, it must be a felt relation" (JAMES, 1901; cited in PARISI, 2009, p. 351). The continuum is not a geometrical abstraction; it is made of prehensions, tensions, mutual graspings.

## Leibniz via Deleuze: The Mathematics of the Curve

If Whitehead provides the metaphysical framework for Parisi's concept of the continuum, Leibniz—as read through Deleuze's *The Fold* (1988)—provides its mathematical articulation. Differential calculus, Leibniz's major contribution to mathematics, offers a means of thinking continuity and discontinuity together, as aspects of the same operation.

Calculus addresses the problem of the infinitesimal: quantities so small that they approach zero while remaining something rather than nothing. The calculus of infinitesimals defines a continuous relationality between the smallest quantities, a continuity to be found in what Parisi, following Deleuze, calls "the vanishing quantity, which retains the character of what is disappearing—a virtual residue" (PARISI, 2009, p. 361). The infinitesimal is not simply nothing; it is the quantity in the process of disappearing that preserves the trace of its own disappearance. This virtual residue constitutes a mode of persistence that is neither presence nor absence but something between or beneath both.

The mathematical figure that corresponds to this conception is not the point but inflection. Bernard Cache, in *Earth Moves* (1995), defines inflection as "the true atom of form, the true object of geography"—not the discrete coordinate but the curvature of the curve, "the slopes and oblique gradients of hills and valleys rather than the bottoms of basins" (CACHE, 1995, p. 16; cited in PARISI, 2009, p. 362). A point of inflection is where the curve changes direction, where numbers move in opposite directions. It is not a location but a transformation, not a position but a passage.

Deleuze draws from Leibniz the thesis that the straight line is always intermingled with curved lines. Rational points on a number line seem to form a complete sequence, but this is what Deleuze calls "a false infinity, a mere indefinite that comprises an infinity of gaps" (DELEUZE, 1993, p. 23; cited in PARISI, 2009, p. 361). Irrational numbers—those that cannot be expressed as ratios of integers—reveal that the seemingly continuous line is riddled with holes that only the curve can traverse. The continuum, from this perspective, is not the smoothness of the line but the curvature that interrupts and connects discrete points.

## Chaitin: Incomputability at the Heart of the Digital

Parisi's most striking intervention is her use of Gregory Chaitin's algorithmic information theory to argue that incomputability is not external to digital computation but constitutive of it. Chaitin's work demonstrates that within the seemingly closed world of binary logic, there exist quantities that are perfectly well-defined mathematically and yet absolutely incomputable.

The paradigmatic example is the Omega number (Ω), which Chaitin defines as "an infinitely long and absolutely incalculable number made of gaping holes, a maximally unknowable number" (CHAITIN, 2005, pp. 129, 143; cited in PARISI, 2009, p. 362). Omega is a real number between zero and one, a decimal point followed by an infinite sequence of digits. Each digit is perfectly determined—it is either 0, 1, 2, and so on up to 9—but it is impossible to compute what any given digit actually is. The digits are, in Chaitin's terms, accidental, random, irreducible.

This randomness, however, is not that of empty space or uniform distribution. Chaitin redefines randomness as maximum entropy, something that cannot be compressed because it has neither pattern nor structure. Randomness in this sense is "a thing in itself," an irreducible quantity that cannot be reduced to simpler elements (PARISI, 2009, p. 362). The interval between zero and one is therefore not a void but an intensive plenitude: "neither a discrete number nor a void, but an intensive quantity defined by an intrinsic numerical variability, that remains computationally open in relation to the configuring constraints of an inexact digit" (PARISI, 2009, p. 362).

The implications for digital theory are significant. If the binary interval between 0 and 1 harbors an incomputable excess, then digital computation cannot be understood as the reduction of the continuous to the discrete. There is, Parisi argues, "a mathematical extensiveness between actual codes containing too much information—a chaotic fuzziness—indivisible into an exact set of equations" (PARISI, 2009, p. 367). The digital does not eliminate the continuum; it generates new modes of continuity, new forms of incomputable surplus.

Let us summarize what is at stake. Common sense opposes analog to digital as the continuous to the discrete: on one side the smooth curve, on the other the step-by-step of 0s and 1s. This opposition suggests that digitization would be a loss—a reduction of continuous flow to a grid of finite values. Yet what Parisi shows, through Whitehead and Chaitin, is that this opposition rests on a misunderstanding of what the digital actually is. Chaitin's Omega number demonstrates this: at the very heart of the binary—in the interval between 0 and 1—there lodges an incomputable, irreducible infinity that exceeds all finite computation. The digital is not the domestication of the continuous by the discrete; it is a regime where continuous and discrete mutually generate each other, where the incomputable inhabits the computed. This changes how we must think about digital media, the computational archive, and algorithmic culture more broadly: not as machines of reduction and total control, but as systems traversed by an excess that is constitutive of them—a continuum that persists within the very discontinuity they seem to impose.

## Margulis: Symbiosis Against Lineage

The biological dimension of Parisi's argument draws on Lynn Margulis's theory of serial endosymbiosis. To understand the importance of this theory, we must first recall the standard narrative of evolution. Neo-Darwinism explains biological complexity through a two-step mechanism: random mutations produce variation; natural selection retains the better-adapted variants. Complexity emerges gradually, through the accumulation of small changes over very long durations. It is a fundamentally additive model: one starts from the simple and adds, piece by piece.

Margulis contests this narrative for a decisive event in the history of life: the appearance of eukaryotic cells—the complex, nucleated cells that compose all animals, plants, and fungi. According to her theory, these cells are not the product of gradual complexification but of fusion: organisms that were once independent—bacteria—incorporated one another to form a new entity. Mitochondria, those organelles that provide energy to our cells, were once free-living bacteria; they were engulfed by a host cell and, instead of being digested, became an integral part of their predator. This is endosymbiosis: life inside another life, not as *parasitism* but as *constitutive cooperation*.

The stakes for Parisi are as follows: endosymbiosis is not addition but relation. The eukaryotic cell is not the sum of its components; it is the product of a mutual incorporation that transforms each term. We find here, at the biological level, the logic of the extensive continuum: discrete entities (bacteria) that extend toward one another, prehend one another, mutually incorporate each other, and generate through this relation a new entity irreducible to its parts. According to Margulis, multicellular or eukaryotic organisms emerged not through gradual genetic modification but through "a symbiotic alliance between distinct colonies of bacteria engendering a new cellular composite" (PARISI, 2009, p. 357).

This symbiotic model contests the dominant understanding of evolution as a process of serial transmission, where genetic information passes from parent to offspring in a single lineage. Whereas genetic or serial algorithms use a finite set of binary characteristics to track evolution within a unique lineage, the symbiotic algorithm "involves the parallel processing of binary characteristics that are neither contained within a unique lineage nor filiatively inheritable" (PARISI, 2009, p. 357). Evolution, from this perspective, proceeds not by inheritance but by infection, not by reproduction but by contamination.

Parisi names this mode of relation "symbiotic sex"—"the infectious activities between parallel algorithms" that allow "the acquisition of genetic material without direct genetic transfer or filiation" (PARISI, 2009, p. 358). The sum of symbiotic combination is "more than two, more than 0 and 1" (PARISI, 2009, p. 358); it exceeds the binary logic of digital inheritance. The continuum, understood symbiotically, is not a smooth flow but a viscous aggregation, a process of mutual infection that connects while preserving difference.

This is why Parisi describes the continuum as "the sticky residue involved in the most minimal and briefest encounters, a kind of biofilmic slime that gels without merging things together in the unnatural caves of an anomalous nature" (PARISI, 2009, p. 354). The continuum does not dissolve differences into identity; it holds differences together in relations of symbiotic dependency. Things gel without merging. They infect without fusing.

## Microperception and the Experience of Continuity

If the continuum is relational rather than substantial, intensive rather than extensive in the ordinary sense, and incomputable rather than computable, it must also be experienced. Parisi insists, following Whitehead and James, that relations are not mere formal structures but felt realities. The continuum operates at the level of what Deleuze, reading Leibniz, calls *microperception*: the tiny imperceptible foldings and unfoldings that occur beneath the threshold of consciousness.

These minute percepts are not simply smaller versions of ordinary perceptions. They are qualitatively different, operating at speeds and scales that consciousness cannot register. Deleuze describes them as "tiny folds that never stop folding and unfolding on the edges of juxtaposed areas, like a mist of folds that makes their surface shimmer, at speeds that no threshold of our consciousness could bear in a normal state" (DELEUZE, 1993, p. 115; cited in PARISI, 2009, p. 366). The continuum is woven from these microscopic events, these vibrations beneath the skin, these passages through states that resonate across all strata of perception.

Whitehead distinguishes between sensible and non-sensible prehension. Sensible perception grasps distinct objects in the here and now; non-sensible or conceptual prehension registers "the continuum of the immediacy of the past into the immediacy of the present" (WHITEHEAD, 1933, pp. 180–181; cited in PARISI, 2009, p. 366). Parisi glosses this as "the activity of feeling continuity within discontinuity" (PARISI, 2009, p. 366). The experience of the continuum is not the perception of a smooth flow but the feeling of connection across ruptures, the prehension of what persists in and through discontinuity.

This experiential dimension has implications for our understanding of computational processes. Parisi argues that differential calculus operates simultaneously at two levels: "one concerns the psycho-metaphysical mechanism of perception, and the other the psycho-organic mechanism of excitation or drive" (DELEUZE, 1993, p. 117; cited in PARISI, 2009, p. 367). The mental and the physical, the conceptual and the organic, are not opposed domains but "two parallel computations symbiotically nested together" (PARISI, 2009, p. 367). The continuum is not a bridge between mind and matter but the relational field in which both are constituted.

## Toward a Definition

On the basis of Parisi's analysis, we can now articulate a definition of the continuum adequate to the contemporary conditions of computational mediation. The continuum is not a smooth and homogeneous substrate underlying discrete differences. It is not a void or empty space separating isolated points. It is not linear history understood as succession and replacement. It is not flow understood as undifferentiated streaming.

The continuum is rather the relational field that generates both continuity and discontinuity through its own operations. It is extensive in the Whiteheadian sense: a stretching, a tension, an effort of connection between events. It is discontinuously continuous: it produces ruptures and gaps while connecting across them, so that earlier events become part of larger events rather than being replaced by them. It is intensive and full rather than extensive and empty: the interval between discrete points is not void but densely packed with incomputable information. It is felt rather than merely formal: it exists in microperceptions, in sensed transitions between states, in the prehensive grasp of what persists through change. It is symbiotic rather than fusional: it connects through infection and contamination, holding differences together without dissolving them into identity.

The continuum, in short, is the incomputable surplus that makes relation possible. It is the curvature that occurs between and within discrete positions, the vanishing quantity that retains the character of what is disappearing. It is neither the line nor the opposition to the line but the folding of the line upon itself, the inflection that reveals the secret curvature of the line.

## Conclusion

Parisi's reconceptualization of the continuum has significant implications for our understanding of the relation between analog and digital media, between photographic inscription and computational generation, between archive and algorithm. If the continuum is not what the digital eliminates but what the digital generates in new forms, then the passage from analog to digital cannot be understood as a simple translation from the continuous to the discrete. Something persists in this passage—not the same thing, not a copy or a representation, but a virtual residue that retains the character of what is disappearing.

This persistence is not historical in the sense of linear succession; it is not the preservation of the past in the present as if the past remained unchanged. It is rather a mode of infection or contamination, by which the past enters into symbiotic relation with the present without being absorbed by it. The continuum is the field in which this symbiosis occurs, the sticky residue that enables relation across difference. To think the analog-digital relation through the concept of the continuum is therefore to refuse the opposition between preservation and loss, between continuity and rupture, in order to attend instead to the incomputable surplus that persists in and through computational mediation.
