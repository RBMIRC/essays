## Archival Praxis in the Age of Artificial Intelligence

---

## Prologue: Impossibility and Method

Can Black Mountain College be revived today? The very question assumes there would be something to reproduce—a model, a formula. Yet that would be precisely to betray what was at stake there.

Black Mountain College (1933–1957) is viewed as a utopian experiment: a place where art, science, agriculture, and philosophy were not separate disciplines but moments of a single experience. Josef and Anni Albers, John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Buckminster Fuller, Robert Rauschenberg—the famous names have sometimes obscured the essential point: a daily experimentation on what a learning community might be. The first integrated institution of higher education in a segregated Southern state, as early as 1944. Horizontal organization, self-governance, collective farm. But also a contingent, conflictual experience, shot through with tensions and failures.

Could and should this institution be revived? As Marguerite Duras wrote: "There are things that are impossible to write, but one can write about the impossibility." Impossibility is not an obstacle; it is a material. The question then becomes: what tactics for working with this impossibility?

For five years, I have been working in the archives of Black Mountain College. More than 180,000 documents scattered between Asheville (NC), Los Angeles (CA), Stanford (CA), Tucson (AZ), New York (NY), Bethany (CT)—a constellation of traces that resists any synthesis. And the further I go, the more I recognize in myself the syndrome that struck the researchers before me: Mary Emma Harris, Martin Duberman, Brenda Danilowitz, and so many others. One enters these archives as a historian; one emerges as something like a belated student of the institution—a *proxy student*, haunted by a pedagogy one never lived through but that continues to act.

This essay is a reflection by an artist-researcher on the legacy of supposed utopias, and the place of archives in the age of artificial intelligence.

## Part I: Retcon as Stance

### 1.1 The Liquid Archive: The Problem

History, as a discipline and as collective consciousness, has long rested on what might be called a metaphysics of sedimentation. The archive, in the positivist imaginary of the nineteenth century, was conceived as a stable geological substrate: a layer of fossilized truth awaiting methodical extraction by the historian-miner. The trace was proof, the indexical sign of an irrefutable "that has been." This solidity was never absolute—archivists have always known this—but it constituted a regulative horizon. One could critique the archive, expose its biases and exclusions, without calling into question the very idea of the document.

What is transforming before our eyes is this very stability. We have passed from the age of sediment to the age of flux. Three mutations converge to produce what I call the *liquefaction of the archive*:

**Mass digitization** tears documents from their contexts. An archival sheet, preserved in an identified repository, photographed in high resolution, uploaded to a database, downloaded in Tokyo or São Paulo, ceases to be *this* particular document, in *this* particular box, consultable according to *these* particular rules. It becomes one image among millions of others, floating in a placeless space. Digitization promises universal access; it also produces generalized decontextualization. The document loses its situation without gaining universality—it gains availability, which is not the same thing.

**Generability** introduces an even more profound rupture. Large language models (LLMs) do not merely store, index, or transmit existing documents. They produce text—and soon image, sound, video—from statistical distributions extracted from massive corpora. The archive ceases to be only what has been preserved; it becomes what can be generated. The distinction between authentic trace and plausible simulation, between document and fabrication, becomes technically undecidable. The "hallucinations" of LLMs—those statements that have every appearance of truth but correspond to nothing—are not malfunctions; they are the symptom of a regime in which plausibility replaces reference.

**Viral circulation** completes the process. An image, an excerpt, a quotation can be copied, modified, recontextualized, diverted at a speed and scale that exceed any possibility of tracing. The document is no longer a fixed point to which one returns; it is a flow one traverses, samples, remixes. Memes are archives; archives become memes.

These three mutations are not technological accidents; they are products of a specific political economy—that of platform capitalism and data extraction. The liquefaction of the archive is inseparable from what Shoshana Zuboff calls "surveillance capitalism": a regime in which every trace, every document, every interaction becomes raw material to exploit. Digital archives do not float in a neutral ether; they circulate in infrastructures owned by private actors, indexed for targeted advertising, ingested for training artificial intelligence models. What I call the *liquid archive* is a neoliberal archive: its flows follow the logics of the market, of extraction, of valorization. The digitized document is no longer merely a trace of the past; it is a resource to exploit, an asset to monetize, a behavioral signal to capture. The training corpora of LLMs—billions of texts, images, codes scraped from the web—are the paradigmatic example of this appropriation: collective intellectual labor, often produced within logics of sharing (forums, wikis, open source repositories), transformed into private capital without consent or compensation. Liquefaction is therefore not a natural condition of the digital; it is the symptom of an accumulation regime that treats collective memory as a resource to extract.

The word *liquid* is not a mere metaphor. It designates a change of state: the passage from a form that resists pressure (the solid) to a form that takes the shape of its container (the liquid). The *liquid archive* no longer has its own form; it takes the form of the devices that process it—search engine, social network, generative model. It flows, infiltrates, mixes.

Wolfgang Ernst, media theorist, formulates this mutation precisely: "The archive shifts from an archival space to an archival time, where the essential is the dynamics of permanent data transmission. [...] The static residential archive as permanent storage is replaced by dynamic temporal storage—the temporal archive as topological site of permanent data transfer." It is no longer a place one visits but a flow one traverses. The archive ceases to be a repository to become a process.

Bernard Stiegler named "tertiary retention" this externalization of memory in technical supports—from cuneiform writing to cloud computing. All human culture rests on these mnesic prostheses that allow transmission beyond individual memory. What Stiegler had not entirely anticipated—he died in 2020, on the threshold of the LLM explosion—is the moment when tertiary retention itself becomes generative. Machines no longer merely store our traces; they produce new ones, according to logics of their own. Stiegler showed how the industrialization of mnemotechnical devices threatens the processes of psychic and collective individuation. In this permanent flux, we risk losing the capacity to distinguish the past from the present, fact from fiction.



### 1.2 The Crisis of Truth: The Impasse

This post-documentary regime is not merely a technical transformation; it is inseparable from a political crisis that has been named, perhaps too hastily, "post-truth."

The term is a trap. It suggests there was once an age of truth, followed by an age where it no longer matters. This is too simple a narrative. Truth has never been given; it has always been constructed, contested, negotiated. What changes is the scale and speed of contestation. When anyone can produce a plausible document, when the distinction between archive and fabrication becomes technically undecidable, when information flows exceed any possibility of verification, then the classical procedures for establishing truth (expertise, institution, consensus) lose their efficacy—not because they were false, but because they presupposed a scarcity (of documents, of speech, of publication) that no longer exists.

Facing this condition, two symmetrical temptations—two impasses.

Nostalgia would return to the solid document, the authentic archive, certified expertise. It dreams of making solid from liquid—but liquid does not resolidify by decree. The walls built against the flow (fact-checking, certification, moderation) are necessary but insufficient; they treat symptoms without touching the condition.

Cynicism draws the opposite conclusion: if everything is manipulable, nothing is true; if everything is construction, we might as well construct what suits us. Cynicism is the posture of power that has understood that truth is a relation of force—and exploits it. It is also the posture of impotence that renounces distinguishing, judging, engaging.

Neither nostalgia nor cynicism constitutes a viable response. The first ignores the condition; the second exploits it. The task, then, is to propose and experiment with a third way, which I propose to call *retcon*.

### 1.3 *Retroactive Continuity*


The term *retcon* comes from the culture industries—comics, television series, transmedia franchises. A contraction of *retroactive continuity*, it designates a narrative procedure by which already-established facts are rearranged to form a new coherent continuity. Joshua Clover defines it thus: "a rearrangement of already given facts into a new logically coherent constellation that can account for later, initially incoherent developments." *Retcon* is neither a correction nor a falsification; it is a recomposition that assumes its anachronism.

Clover insists on the theological origin of the concept before its migration to comic books. The theologian Wolfhart Pannenberg, in a Hegelian perspective, held that history is the unfolding of divine revelation—a process that can only be understood by reading backward from its end. Elgin Frank Tupper, commenting on Pannenberg, writes: "Pannenberg's conception of retroactive continuity ultimately means that history flows fundamentally from the future into the past, that the future is not essentially a product of the past." This temporal inversion—the future determining the past rather than the reverse—is the core of *retcon*.

Clover pushes the analysis further by linking this temporal operation to political economy. He argues that "credit is a form of time travel: it is a way of spending in the present the value of work yet to come. Debt, symmetrically, is what knows what you will do next summer." In a financialized economy, credit captures a future value (a promise of repayment) to inject it into the present. *Retcon* functions analogously on the narrative and historical plane: it is a form of temporal arbitrage.

But beware the trap. The financial metaphor might suggest that *retcon* reproduces the logic of capital—that reactivating the past means "monetizing" it differently. That would be precisely the gesture of capitalist realism: reducing everything to valorization. The *retcon* I propose is not an investment expecting returns; it is a default. It refuses the terms of the contract—the idea that the past is a resource to exploit, that utopia is an asset to capitalize on. Borrowing from the past to make the present solvent, yes—but knowing we will never repay in the currency demanded of us.

Fredric Jameson, thinking about science fiction, formulates a complementary idea. The "multiple fictional futures" of SF, he writes, "serve a very different function: to transform our own present into the determined past of something yet to come." SF does not predict the future; it makes the present historicizable by projecting it as the past of an imagined future. *Retcon* operates the same displacement, but in the other direction: it makes the past actualizable by projecting it as the origin of a reconfigured present. In both cases, the arrow of time is reversed; in both cases, it is the later term that determines the earlier. Classical causality—from past to future, from cause to effect—gives way to a speculative continuum where it is the horizon that redistributes origins.

Applied to archives, *retcon* ceases to be a mere narrative procedure to become a *praxis*—a mode of engagement with the past that is simultaneously theoretical and practical, critical and productive.

*Retcon* refuses nostalgia: it does not claim to restore a lost solidity. It acknowledges that the archive has always been worked—by those who constituted it, classified it, preserved it, destroyed it. Machines only make explicit and amplify what was already there: the archive is not a mirror of the past but a device that refracts it. Retcon assumes this refraction instead of deploring it.

But *retcon* also refuses cynicism: it does not renounce responsibility. To recognize that every archive is constructed is not to say that all constructions are equal. There are refractions that open possibilities and refractions that close them. There are uses of the archive that give voice to silences and uses that redouble them. Karen Barad speaks of the "cuts" we make in the real—those decisions, often implicit, that separate what counts from what does not count, what is visible from what remains in shadow. We are responsible for our cuts, including—especially—when they are operated by machines we have built or use.

*Retcon* is a stance: neither nostalgia nor cynicism, but work from within liquidity. Assuming that the archive is liquid, that tools transform it, that narratives are constructions—and maintaining nonetheless a demand: that these constructions be explicit, collective, open to contestation.

The real guarantee, perhaps the only one, is the collective dimension. A *retcon* produced by an individual alone before their machine is a private hallucination; a *retcon* validated, contested, transformed by a community becomes a shared fiction, subject to debate—exactly as in fanfiction communities, where canon is never given but always renegotiated. The workshops are not a spiritual supplement to the project; they are its ethical safeguard.

### 1.4 The Prismatic Archive: The Form

Facing liquefaction—this dissolution of the archive into data flows, its appropriation by the extractive logics of platform capitalism—two responses present themselves: attempting to resolidify (which is futile) or inventing another form. This other form I call the *prismatic archive*.

The *prismatic archive* is neither solid (it does not claim the fixity of the authentic document) nor liquid (it does not dissolve into undifferentiated flow). It is *refractive*: it deflects, decomposes, disperses what passes through it. As the optical prism decomposes white light into a spectrum of colors, the prismatic archive decomposes the past into a multiplicity of narratives, temporalities, possibilities. It does not produce a truth but a *multiverse*—in the literal sense: multiple worlds, coexisting space-times, versions that do not exclude but interfere with one another.

The *prismatic archive* is simultaneously *multispatial* (it exists in dispersed places, heterogeneous supports, different communities working on it simultaneously) and *multitemporal* (it makes strata of time coexist—the past of documents, the present of readings, the futures it opens). It is the form the archive takes when one ceases wanting to fix it and accepts inhabiting its dispersion.

The prism is not a formula; it is what Kant called a *schema*—an operator that aids thinking without claiming to exhaust its object. I extend the metaphor not to naturalize the archive but to make its transformation effects perceptible. The danger would be constructing a "physics of the archive" that naturalizes what it claims to deconstruct. I will endeavor to avoid this by keeping visible the gap between the image and what it illuminates.

*Retcon* is the practice that activates this prismatic potentiality—not to produce a unified narrative, but to generate multiverse.

### 1.5 Artificial Intelligence: The Milieu

In this landscape, artificial intelligence is not one tool among others. It constitutes a new milieu (Uexküll)—in the sense that water is the milieu of the fish, air that of the bird. One does not use a milieu then set it down; one bathes in it, it conditions perception and action. To grasp this conditioning, we must pose a simple question: what does an LLM do when it "processes" an archive?

It *tokenizes*: it cuts the text into units (tokens) that correspond neither to words nor to concepts but to fragments statistically optimal for processing. The document loses its own syntax to enter a computational grammar.

It vectorizes: it projects each token into a mathematical space of several hundred dimensions, where "proximity" between two terms is not semantic but distributional—two words are close if they appear in similar contexts, not if they mean similar things.

It probabilizes: it learns to predict the next token based on the preceding ones, constructing a model of language that is a model of conditional probabilities, not a model of meanings.

This applies to textual archives. Audiovisual documents undergo an analogous treatment: images are cut into patches, sound into spectrograms, video into vectorized sequences. The materiality of the medium—grain of the film, timbre of the voice, texture of the filmed fabric—dissolves into a common latent space where everything becomes translatable into everything else, but where sensory specificities are erased.

This process constitutes what I call a *transduction*—a passage between heterogeneous semiotic regimes (I borrow the term from Simondon, inflecting it: where he describes a structuring propagation within a milieu, I designate here the passage between heterogeneous milieus—from the semiotic to the computational). Text (regime of meaning, syntax, reference) becomes token (regime of segmentation), then vector (regime of geometry), then probability (regime of calculation). At each stage, something is lost and something is produced. What is lost: context, intention, enunciative situation. What is produced: patterns, regularities, correlations invisible to the human eye.

*Deep learning* systems do not "understand" the archive in the sense that a historian understands it. They extract distributions. They do not "read"; they sample. And when they generate, they do not "say" anything—they produce probable sequences given what they have ingested. This is what I call the *statistical prism*: AI sees history through the lens of correlation and pattern recognition, not through the lens of causality, intentionality, or singular context.

This prism has a major consequence: *hallucination as method*. When a model is fed partial and fragmentary archives, it seeks to fill the gaps by applying a logic of statistical continuity. It predicts what *should* be found where there is nothing. Algorithmic hallucination is, in this sense, the technical manifestation of *retcon*: it produces "retroactive continuity" where the historical archive presents a discontinuity.

This does not mean that AI is useless or dangerous in itself. It means that it constitutes a specific milieu with its own laws, its own biases, its own productions. To work with AI on an archive is not to use a neutral tool; it is to plunge the document into a milieu that transforms it—as the prism transforms the light that passes through it.

Within this controlled rather than suffered framework, algorithmic biases are not accidents to correct; they are the signature of its milieu. What is overrepresented in training corpora (English, digitized texts, institutional sources) will be overrepresented in outputs. What is absent from corpora (minority languages, non-digitized archives, oral traditions) will remain invisible. AI amplifies what already exists in archival power relations. It does not create inequalities of memory; it accelerates them.

The algorithm thus risks smoothing history, eliminating the radical singularities (the "hapaxes") that constitute the richness of the historical event, reducing them to an acceptable statistical average. One must navigate between two pitfalls: normative smoothing (where AI produces a sanitized version, a generic utopia) and hallucinatory chaos (where the machine produces meaningless noise). This is where human—and collective—work intervenes: to introduce "grain," friction, and prevent the total liquefaction of meaning.

## Part II: Retcon as Methodology

### 2.1 The Archive as Apparatus

The first problem posed by any archive is that of its status. What does a document document?

The naive answer would be: facts. Meeting minutes document what was said; a photograph documents what happened; a letter documents what someone thought. The archive would be a reservoir of traces from which to reconstitute the past.

But anyone who has spent time in archives knows this answer does not hold. The minutes do not say what was said; they say what the secretaries judged worth retaining, in a form that obeys conventions, for anticipated readers. The photograph does not show what happened; it shows what the photographer framed, at a chosen instant, with an apparatus that has its own constraints. The letter does not give access to a thought; it gives access to what someone wanted to make someone else believe, in a specific enunciative context.

Michel Foucault named *apparatus* (*dispositif*) this heterogeneous ensemble of discourses, institutions, regulations, philosophical propositions, administrative decisions—everything that, at a given epoch, constitutes the framework within which something can be said, thought, archived. The archive is not the reflection of an external reality; it is produced by an apparatus that determines what is archivable and what is not, what is sayable and what remains mute.

Jacques Derrida, in *Archive Fever*, pushes further. He shows that the archive is worked by a contradictory drive: to preserve and to destroy. To archive is always also to exclude—to decide that this deserves to be kept and that can disappear. The "fever" of the archive is this compulsion to keep everything that constantly collides with the impossibility of keeping everything. What enters the archive does so at the price of what does not enter.

Ariella Aïsha Azoulay radicalizes this analysis by showing that the archive is, from its origin, an imperial instrument. In *Potential History: Unlearning Imperialism*, she argues that the modern archive is inseparable from the colonial project: it classifies, orders, surveys, extracts—it transforms living worlds into administrable documents. The archive is not a neutral space of preservation; it is an apparatus of sovereignty that determines who can speak, who can be seen, who counts as a historical subject. Colonial, photographic, ethnographic archives have been tools of dispossession as much as documentation. For Azoulay, "unlearning imperialism" passes through a radical transformation of our relationship to the archive—not abandoning it, but turning it around, making it a space of reparation rather than domination.

To read an archive as an apparatus is to stop asking it "what happened" and to ask instead "what was made visible, and at what price." It is to attend to silences as much as to speech, to margins as much as to the center, to conditions of production as much as to content.

### 2.2 Diffractive Reading

The second problem is that of reading method. How does one traverse an archive one knows to be an apparatus?

A first answer would be ideological critique: to unmask biases, reveal exclusions, show what the archive hides. This approach has its value—it has nourished decades of critical history. But it still assumes a position of overview: the critic who knows what the archive ignores, who sees what it dissimulates. It maintains an asymmetry between reader (lucid) and document (ideological).

Karen Barad, feminist physicist and philosopher, proposes another path that she names *diffractive reading*. Diffraction, in optics, is what occurs when a wave encounters an obstacle or passes through a slit: it bends, divides, interferes with itself to produce new patterns. Unlike reflection (which returns the same) or refraction (which deflects), diffraction produces difference.

Barad thus opposes the metaphor of the mirror—positivist history holds a mirror to the past to reproduce its reflection—to that of diffraction—which does not reproduce the same but maps interferences. Diffractive reading consists in passing texts through one another—not to compare them from outside, but to observe the interference patterns they produce. It is not seeking truth "in the middle" between two contradictory sources; it is observing how their encounter generates something that was in neither. A diffractive methodology is a critical practice that seeks to understand "which differences matter."

Donna Haraway adds a dimension: all knowledge is situated. There is no view from nowhere, no god's-eye point of view from which one would see the archive "as it is." The reader is always somewhere—in a body, a history, a social position, an epoch. To recognize this situation is not an admission of weakness; it is the condition of responsible knowledge. It is because I am situated that I can be responsible for what I do with the archive.

Concretely, diffractive reading consists in passing several strata through one another—and observing what appears in the interference.

Take the archives of Black Mountain College. The Board of Fellows minutes from 1948 say one thing; the interviews conducted by Mary Emma Harris in 1972 say another. The document is synchronic, filtered by the conventions of administrative writing; the testimony is retrospective, reconstructed by what the witness has become. Diffractive reading does not arbitrate between the two to establish "what really happened." It observes the gap: what surfaces in the difference? What tensions did the minutes smooth over? What repressions does the testimony let slip despite itself? The interference between these two strata produces a third text—that of possibilities that did not come to pass.

Another diffraction: that of the archive against the machine. When I submit a corpus of documents to a language model and it generates a narrative, this narrative is neither faithful reflection of sources nor pure hallucination. It is a diffraction: the original text passed through the model's statistical distributions, its Anglophone biases, its majority patterns, its blind spots. The deformations, amplifications, silences of the generated narrative say nothing about "what happened"—but they reveal the encounter between a singular archive and a generic computational milieu. What AI amplifies betrays what was overrepresented; what it omits signals what was already missing.

Finally, my own reading diffracts against those of others. I am not the only reader. The collective workshops of research-creation pass the archive through other bodies, other social positions, other political urgencies. Architecture students in Versailles do not read the campus plans like residents of Eden, North Carolina. Queer artists do not interrogate the archive's silences like art historians. These divergences are not errors to correct nor "subjective interpretations" to set aside—they are additional diffractions that enrich the pattern. Each reading adds a frequency to the spectrum.

This method does not produce a single truth; it produces a cartography of differences—a map of points where interferences manifest, where tensions become visible, where possibilities open. It thus responds to the question posed by archival multiverse theory: "How can we accept that there may exist incommensurable ontologies and epistemologies between communities [...] and find ways to accept and work within this reality?" Diffractive reading does not seek to reconcile incommensurable ontologies; it puts them in contact to observe what their friction produces.

### 2.3 *Walking in the Dreams of Others* (Huyghe)

The artist Pierre Huyghe speaks of "walking in the dreams of others" to describe Armstrong's first steps on the moon and, by extension, what occurs when one enters a world that preexists—narrative, fiction, myth. In *The Third Memory* (1999), he has John Wojtowicz reenact the bank robbery that had inspired Sidney Lumet's *Dog Day Afternoon*. Wojtowicz walks in the dream of another (Lumet's film) which was itself a version of his own lived experience. The layers pile up: event, film, reenactment—and none is more "true" than the others. "I am not interested in representation but in presence," Huyghe specifies. "Not in the image of a thing but in the situation in which that thing exists."

Archives are such solidified dreams—imaginary worlds (that of an epoch as it was lived, thought, desired) that have taken material form in documents. To enter the archive is to enter this dream, not as spectator of past images but as walker in a space that continues to produce effects. Derrida, in *Archive Fever*, analyzes this spectral dimension: the archive is haunted by what it preserves. It is not a neutral container but a place where the dead continue to act upon the living. "The question of the archive is not a question of the past [...] it is a question of the future, the very question of the future."

But the dream can engulf. One can get lost in it, drown in it, go around in circles. Haunting can become paralysis—this is the syndrome of the researcher who never leaves the archives, who accumulates index cards without ever writing, who lets themselves be absorbed by the past to the point of no longer being able to act in the present. It is here that retcon intervenes as lucidity.

The lucid dream is that state where the dreamer knows they are dreaming and can, to some extent, act upon the dream. *Retcon* allows one to navigate actively in the dream of the archive—not merely to let oneself be haunted by it, but to intervene in it, to trace paths through it, to produce new forms within it. It is rewriting that assumes itself to be oneiric. Without this lucidity, work on the archive remains melancholic contemplation; with it, it becomes praxis.

This conception has implications for the question of the commons. The dream, unlike property, is not exhausted in use. When I walk in a dream, I do not consume it—I augment it. My own images add to inherited images; my traversals leave traces for other walkers. The dream is a generative commons: not a resource to share but a space enriched by each person's contributions. Archives, treated as shared dream, become such a commons. Each new project that activates them—each article, each exhibition, each workshop—adds to the dream without diminishing it.

### 2.4 The Feedback Loop

The third problem concerns temporality. The archive seems fixed—it has been there, in its boxes, for decades. But work on the archive is not: it modifies what one seeks, what one sees, what one produces. How to think this dynamic?

Cybernetics—that current of thought born in the 1940s around Norbert Wiener, Gregory Bateson, Heinz von Foerster—forged a concept for this: the *feedback loop*. A system in a loop is a system where output returns to affect input. The thermostat is the trivial example: it measures temperature, triggers heating if it is too low, and the new temperature becomes the new measurement—and so on.

What interests second-order cybernetics (von Foerster, Maturana, Varela) is the moment when the observer themselves is included in the loop. I am not outside the system I observe; I am part of it. My observations modify the system; the modified system modifies my observations; and so on. There is no fixed point, no external position—only recursivities.

The Retcon Black Mountain project does not proceed linearly from archives to finished product. It coils upon itself in successive loops, each of which relaunches the others.

First, the archive enters the machine. Documents are ingested by language models configured for this task; these produce narrative sequences—dialogues, descriptions, scenes—that are not conclusions but propositions, raw materials for what follows. Then these sequences pass to the collective. Submitted to groups of participants—students, artists, residents—they are modified, contested, diverted. A generated dialogue becomes something else when a participant introduces a tension the AI had not seen, or refuses a scene they judge false. These transformations do not amend the machine; they stratify the narrative. All of this is then documented: initial sequences, modifications, discussions, refusals—an archive of the archive, available to others, for later, for unforeseen uses.

Finally, a workshop's results bring forth questions no one had asked—about a forgotten character, a misunderstood place, an unexplained silence. These questions send us back to the original documents, but the gaze has changed. We no longer seek the same thing. The loop closes and opens again.

This cycle has no predetermined end. It does not converge toward a stable truth; it spirals, producing new diffractions with each turn. Consequence: I do not control the project. I initiate it, frame it, provide tools and protocols—but what happens in the loops partly escapes me. It is precisely this loss of control that makes it fertile.

### 2.5 The Protocol: Description of Operations

The work begins in the United States, in archival repositories—principally the Western Regional Archives in Asheville but also at the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation, at Stanford University, Yale, and the New York Public Library. There I collect, digitize, and transcribe documents: minutes, correspondence, photographs, sound recordings, course programs, oral testimonies. From this mass, I constitute a digital corpus—which is not the archive but a cut, a selection, a transformation. What I include and what I exclude, the formats I retain, the metadata I add: all of this configures what the machines will be able to "see." The constitution of the corpus is already interpretive.

This corpus is then submitted to artificial intelligence systems configured for this task. This does not mean using an "off-the-shelf" language model and asking it questions. I have developed specific tools: chatbots trained on the corpus, decentralized archiving systems, search engines indexing several thousand documents. These tools are my tools—but I must be precise about what this means. I coded the interfaces; I did not train the underlying language models. These models remain, for the most part, statistical black boxes whose biases—Western-centric, Anglophone, smoothing singularities toward averages—largely escape me. I do not control the tool; I curate its accidents. AI is not a docile brush that executes my intentions; it is an alien partner whose productions surprise me, resist me, displace me. This ungovernable part is not a defect to correct; it is constitutive of the method. Antoinette Rouvroy, analyzing what she calls "algorithmic governmentality," warns that computational systems operate a "reduction of potentiality to probability"—a "closure of statistical 'reality' upon itself." AI, left to itself, tends to reproduce dominant patterns; it smooths singularities, amplifies averages, closes possibilities. Retcon must therefore work against this tendency—not by refusing the tool but by creating conditions to reopen what the machine tends to close.

The generated productions—dialogues, descriptions, scenes—must then be formatted. The choice of a format, comic book or storyboard, imposes constraints that oblige showing rather than describing abstractly. The result is not an illustration of the archives; it is a transposition that obeys its own rules.

Then comes the decisive stage, not only methodologically but ethically: the collective workshops of research-creation. The generated sequences are submitted to groups of participants—students, artists, volunteers, depending on opportunities—invited to transform them. I first present the project, its stakes, its context; I do not hide the machinic nature of the productions, on the contrary I make it explicit. Participants receive sequences they do not necessarily know. They are invited to modify them: change the dialogues, add characters, move scenes, introduce contemporary elements, contest the presuppositions. They can also refuse—this right to refuse is essential. The transformations are then shared and discussed; divergences are welcome, interpretive conflicts are where what can be said is negotiated.

Fred Moten and Stefano Harney, in *The Undercommons* (2013), propose the concept of *study* to name a collective practice that escapes the logics of academic productivity. Study is neither the institutional seminar nor the creative workshop in the conventional sense; it is what happens when people gather to think together, without predefined program, without expected output, in the margins and interstices of the institution. "It is talking, walking, working, dancing, suffering—an irreducible and inconsolable practice that takes place within and against the frame." The project's workshops attempt to make space for this study. Not producing images—even if images are produced—but creating conditions for collective thinking about what we do with archives, with machines, with ghosts. The right to refuse is essential to this logic: study supposes one can not produce, can stop, contest, bifurcate. It resists capture by productivity metrics. This dimension distinguishes retcon from simple AI-assisted archive processing. We are not in a logic of optimization where the machine would accelerate a preexisting research process; we are in a logic of experimentation where the encounter between archives, machines, and collectives produces something unforeseen—and where this unforeseen is the value, not a malfunction to correct.

Everything is documented: transformations, discussions, hesitations, refusals. Theorists of the archival multiverse—Anne Gilliland, Sue McKemmish, Andrew Lau, and their collaborators—have shown that classical archival science, inherited from nineteenth-century European positivism, rests on a reduction it does not recognize as such. It sees only two dimensions: the physical dimension (material support, preservation, access) and the intellectual dimension (classification, description, indexing). This reduction is not neutral; it is a gesture of power that makes invisible other relations to the trace—and that presents as universal a situated, Western, modern conception.

Non-Western epistemologies do not simply "complete" this framework with missing dimensions; they contest its presuppositions. Michelle Caswell, working with marginalized communities in the United States—queer communities, racialized communities, survivor communities—has highlighted the "affective bonds" that unite these communities to their archives. For someone whose history has been systematically erased, accessing a trace of their ancestors is not a neutral act of data extraction; it is an act charged with affects, sometimes painful, sometimes liberating. The archive is not only a repository of information but a space of recognition, mourning, reparation.

The protocols developed by Indigenous communities of Australia and New Zealand go further still. Certain materials are sacred; certain can only be viewed by initiated persons; certain require rituals before consultation. These protocols are not access restrictions in the bureaucratic sense—they are the expression of an ontology where the archive is not an inert object but a being in relation with the living and the dead. Here, it is not only archival method that is called into question, but the very conception of what a document is, what it means to preserve, what can be shown and to whom.

These thoughts are not resources to plunder to enrich a Western methodology. They constitute a critical horizon that reminds us of the limits of my own position. The project's workshops attempt to make space—imperfect, situated, conscious of its blind spots—for some of these occluded dimensions: time for discussion rather than efficiency of extraction, attention to hesitations rather than demand for answers, the right to refuse rather than obligation to produce, recognition that certain materials may be painful and that this pain is not an obstacle to circumvent but information to hear. I do not claim to apply Indigenous protocols to which I have no access; I claim that their existence obliges me to interrogate what I do—and not to naturalize the presuppositions of the archival science in which I was trained.

## Part III: Retcon as Subject—Black Mountain College

### 3.1 Why Black Mountain College

If retcon is a praxis of art with archives in the age of artificial intelligence, why exercise it on the archives of Black Mountain College? The answer is not only biographical—even if I have been working on this terrain for years, even if the haunting I spoke of at the beginning is quite real.

The answer lies in what Black Mountain College offers as terrain of experimentation for this condition. For BMC is not only a historical institution; it is an interrupted utopia—and interrupted utopias haunt differently than accomplished projects. What has ended can be evaluated, judged, classified; what was interrupted remains open, charged with all that could have come to pass and did not. Black Mountain College closed in 1957, for lack of money, undermined by internal conflicts, exhausted. But its closure did not close the possibilities it had opened—it suspended them.

What haunts, in the BMC archives, is not only what took place—the courses, the performances, the documented conflicts. It is what was dreamed there: an education without separation between art and life, a community without rigid hierarchy between teachers and students, a thought that would not distinguish the hand from the mind. These dreams were not fully realized—BMC was also a place of tensions, dominations, exclusions. But they were formulated, experimented, sometimes approached. They exist in the archives in the state of traces—fragments of what was attempted, indices of what was desired.

Ernst Bloch spoke of "utopian contents not yet conscious of themselves"—those aspirations buried in the cultural productions of the past, waiting to be reactivated. The BMC archives are saturated with these contents. Not because BMC was a paradise—it was not—but because it was a place where people took seriously the possibility of doing otherwise. This taking-seriously leaves traces, even when it fails. Especially when it fails.

Retcon finds here its privileged object. It is not a matter of restoring BMC, mythifying it, or reproducing it—the context has changed too much, and any reproduction would be pastiche. It is a matter of reactivating the dreams deposited there, of making them work in a present that needs them. We live in an epoch where education is submitted to metrics, where art is captured by the market, where community is fragmented by platforms. The questions BMC posed—how to learn together? how to create without separating theory and practice? how to live in common without reproducing dominations?—have not been resolved; they have been abandoned. Retcon takes them up again, not to answer them but to keep them open.

Black Mountain College is therefore less an object of study than a spectral partner. Its archives are not a corpus to process but a solidified dream in which to walk—to find there, perhaps, paths its inhabitants had not had time to trace.

BMC's documents have never been gathered into a single collection. They are scattered between North Carolina, Connecticut, California, Arizona, New York, and countless private collections. This dispersal is not a defect to correct; it is the native condition of this archive. BMC never had a central mirror that would return a unified image of it; it always functioned as a prism, scattering its traces in multiple directions.

What happened at Black Mountain—pedagogy without fixed discipline, community without stable hierarchy, art without separation from life—resists linear narration. The hundreds of interviews conducted by Mary Emma Harris and Martin Duberman with former members show versions that do not coincide, memories that contradict each other, narratives that clash. The BMC archive is natively plural; *retcon* does not impose a foreign condition on it, it reveals its structure. BMC was already, in its lifetime, a multiverse: European artists fleeing Nazism, experimental composers, objectivist poets, visionary engineers, students from very diverse backgrounds—all cohabited without their ontologies fusing.

Questions remain open. The racial integration practiced from 1944—ten years before Brown v. Board of Education, in a segregationist Southern state—is not an accomplished fact to commemorate. It is an unfinished gesture we inherit. Who were BMC's Black students? What was their real experience, beyond the heroic narrative? Similarly for horizontal organization: how did it actually function? What conflicts did it produce? Why did it ultimately collapse? These questions are not historical in the sense of a closed past; they are current, because they concern what we are still trying to do.

Stuart Hall distinguishes, in cultural analysis, the dominant, the emergent, and the residual. The residual consists of those formations of the past that have not been entirely absorbed by the dominant order, that remain available for other uses. BMC is such a residual—not a model to imitate (the institution failed, dissolved, lasted only twenty-four years) but a reserve of possibilities, a virtuality that continues to act.

Cognitive capitalism has since captured its vocabulary—"creativity," "interdisciplinarity," "experiential learning"—to put it in the service of economic valorization. "Third places" and "fab labs" recycle the aesthetics of experimentation without taking up its political dimension. *Retcon* aims to undo this capture—to distinguish the utopian gesture from its recuperation, not to reconstitute BMC as it was, but to reactivate what it made thinkable.

### 3.2 What the Archives Contain

The Black Mountain College archives are not a homogeneous block. They are made of heterogeneous strata, accumulated over twenty-four years of the institution's existence (1933–1957), then over nearly seventy years of dispersal, rediscovery, valorization. Heather South, archivist at the Western Regional Archives in Asheville, recalls in an interview conducted in December 2024 as part of a seminar at the École des Beaux-Arts de Marseille: "We have about 600 boxes of Black Mountain College materials in our collections. And that number keeps growing."

These 600 boxes come from different acts of collection: administrative archives transferred at the College's closure, research collections constituted by Mary Emma Harris in the 1970s, direct donations from former students and families. Each stratum has its own biases, its own silences. Administrative documents are filtered by the conventions of institutional writing; oral testimonies are reconstructed by time; donations depend on who kept what, and who wanted to give.

But what constitutes an archival document? Heather South poses the question: "Have you ever thought that your class notes from university could be considered a historical document? In this case, class notes are the only access we have to what was being taught and how it was being taught. There were no syllabi; it is the individual students' notes that allow us to understand the lessons."

Certain objects defy categories. South evokes the programs from David Tudor's piano recital in 1953—"the only two known copies are in our collection. They were designed and printed on the BMC press by Tommy Brooks, on cigarette paper. You were supposed to smoke the program as part of the audience's participation in the performance." Document or work? Archive or artifact? The boundary blurs—and this blurring says something about BMC itself, where art and daily life were not separated.

What is missing is as important as what exists. South acknowledges it: "There were suicides, mental health issues, sexual harassment, affairs between professors... But I like to say that's history, warts and all." The voices of students who did not "succeed," the traces of Black workers employed on the farm, conflicts that were not recorded—the archive is full of holes. These holes are not accidents; they are the signature of the apparatus that produced the archive.

### 3.3 Reading Along the Grain

Ann Laura Stoler, in her work on Dutch colonial archives (*Along the Archival Grain*, 2009), proposes a method that refuses to extract "pure facts" from documents. To read *with* the archive—along its grain—is to attend to its texture, its obsessions, what it repeats and what it avoids. The colonial archive, Stoler shows, does not only document the colonized; it documents the fears of the colonizers. Administrative categories betray anxieties; recorded rumors are symptoms. To read along the grain is to take the archive seriously in what it reveals despite itself.

Applied to Black Mountain College, this method transforms what South describes as "history, warts and all" into an object of analysis. The Board of Fellows minutes do not document a horizontal democracy; they document a *struggle* for horizontality—often lost. The silences on gender and intimacy are not neutral absences; they are the signature of an apparatus that made certain things unspeakable. What the BMC archive reveals despite itself is the distance between proclaimed utopia and lived experience—not to disqualify utopia, but to measure its cost.

### 3.4 The Archive of *Retcon*

Since 2019, the Retcon Black Mountain project has unfolded as research-creation: workshops in European art schools (École Nationale Supérieure d'Architecture de Versailles and Paris-Est, HEAD Geneva, École Nationale Supérieure de la Photographie d'Arles, Académie royale des Beaux-Arts Brussels, and elsewhere), residencies in North Carolina, and creation of the Eden Summer Institute—an experimental program of several weeks, in Eden (NC), that attempts to reactivate something of BMC's pedagogy in a contemporary context. What the project produces—comic book, documentation, film in preparation—does not only constitute an archive *about* Black Mountain. It constitutes an archive *with* Black Mountain—a temporal stratum that joins the strata of 1933–1957 not as a later commentary, but as a concomitant layer.

It is here that the *prismatic archive* reveals its most radical dimension. In the classical regime, time is linear: past precedes present which precedes future. The archive of 1945 is *before*; our reading of 2025 is *after*. But *retcon* operates a temporal torsion. By retroactively rearranging facts, by generating narratives that "could have" existed, by making period documents and contemporary transformations work together, the project creates a continuum where times coexist. The sequences produced in 2025 do not comment on BMC from outside; they add themselves to the archive as if they had always been part of it—or rather, as if the distinction between "origin" and "addition" lost its pertinence.

This coexistence is neither illusion nor falsification. It is the truth of the *prismatic archive*: a multitemporal continuum where 1944 and 2025 are not successive dates but simultaneous frequencies of the same spectrum. The Black woman student arriving at BMC in 1945, as we imagined her in workshop, is neither historical fact nor contemporary fiction—she is a presence that traverses the continuum, that resonates between the original archive (where she is a silence) and the archive of *retcon* (where she takes form).

And this resonance does not stop at the present. The archive we produce is oriented toward a future not yet come—those *lost futures* Mark Fisher spoke of, those possibilities that were not realized but have not disappeared either. By documenting our work, by making it accessible and transformable, we create conditions for others—in ten years, in fifty years—to in turn add their strata, their diffractions, their resonances. The archive of retcon is not a monument to the past; it is a device for transmission toward futures still undetermined.

What we produce in 2025 lodges itself between strata: alongside BMC documents as if it had always belonged to them, in our present as trace of what we attempt, toward futures not yet come as call to continue. The archive of retcon does not classify times; it makes them coexist—and circulate.

## Conclusion: What We Teach Black Mountain College

### The Reversal

At the beginning of this work, the question seemed obvious: what can we learn from Black Mountain College? The experimental institution, alternative pedagogies, communitarian utopia—so many lessons to extract, models to adapt, inspirations to transpose. BMC as source, we as receivers; the past as deposit, the present as beneficiary.

The principle of this research-creation reformulates the initial question. To ask what Black Mountain College teaches us is already to posit the archive as deposit and ourselves as receivers—the closed past on one side, the present that draws from it on the other. It is to risk counterproductive worship: celebrating utopia without taking it up again, capitalizing on the myth until it is exhausted—extracting value from it while emptying it of its substance.

The work I have conducted over the past five years has led me to reverse the question. What interests me now is not what BMC teaches us; it is *what we teach Black Mountain College*.

This reversal is not a rhetorical game. It names a real transformation of the relationship to the archive. In the post-documentary regime I have described, the archive is no longer a stable deposit one consults; it is a plastic milieu one transforms. The tools we use—artificial intelligence, collective workshops, devices of generation and diffraction—are not neutral means of accessing preexisting content. They produce this content as much as they reveal it.

When I submit BMC's archives to a language model, when I pass the outputs through collective workshops, when I document the transformations and reinject them into the corpus—I do not *discover* BMC. I *compose* it. I teach it something it did not know: what it becomes when it passes through our machines, our collectives, our questions.

### The Pedagogical Loop

This inversion has a properly pedagogical dimension—which is not a coincidence for a project centered on an educational institution.

Black Mountain College was founded on an intuition: education is not the transmission of constituted knowledge from master to student, but a process of co-construction where teachers and students learn together. John Andrew Rice, the founder, wrote that the professor should be "a student among students." Josef Albers refused to give solutions; he posed problems. Charles Olson improvised his courses, transforming them into performances where thought sought itself aloud. This pedagogy—which I have elsewhere called the *exposed teacher*—rests on an epistemic symmetry: the one who teaches does not know in advance what will happen, they expose themselves to the risk of learning.

The loop of *retcon* extends this gesture. We teach BMC—we teach it what it becomes in our machines, our workshops, our narratives, we give it forms it did not have. And BMC teaches us—not ready-made lessons, but unresolved problems. In working on its archives, we do not find answers; we refine our questions.

I return, finally, to ghosts. I began this text with a scene of haunting: voices calling from an archive, an impossibility of not responding. The ghosts of Black Mountain are not revenants to be appeased by giving them a definitive burial. They are active presences that continue to pose questions, to trouble our certainties, to open possibilities. They do not ask to be left in peace; they ask to be put to work.

*Retcon* is a way of responding to this demand—not by reconstituting what happened, but by passing ghosts through our devices, by mingling them with our questions, by letting them transform us as much as we transform them. Derrida wrote that the ghost is what returns—what does not cease to return because it was never fully present. Black Mountain College was never fully present to itself; it was traversed by contradictions, unaccomplished possibilities, suspended virtualities. This is why it can return—not as what it was, but as what it has not finished being.

What we teach Black Mountain College is that it is not finished.

Fidelity to history does not consist in repeating what was, but in remaining faithful to the promise of what could have been. It is a fidelity to the virtual, an ethics of potentiality. In the hour of generalized liquefaction, this is perhaps the only form of solidity left to us: the solidity of the possible. This, at least, is the attempt of the work we are pursuing: Retcon Black Mountain.
